# Trusted


> The situation is bad. The magistrate database from the Sagittarius sector has been leaked!
> The incident response team continues to see unknown connections in the logs from outside the sector, even though the passwords have all been changed.
> We suspect the problem is with the authentication portalâ€¦ Do something about it!

In this chall, we are given a [trusted.py](https://github.com/Nouman404/nouman404.github.io/blob/main/_posts/) and the goal is to find the password used by the hacker on its malicious file.
