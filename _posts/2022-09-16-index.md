This is my personal page. Here I will upload notes cybersecurity related (pentesting, forensic, crypto, malware, training,...). All of this post have been created by my own and can content errors. You can find more about me in [whoami](/whoami). The contents of this page will be divided into three main categories: **writeups**, **malware** and **notes**.
