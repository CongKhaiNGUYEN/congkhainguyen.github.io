# File
Files must be named as `name.asm`. In order to compile it:
```console
zero@pio$ nasm -f elf <file>
zero@pio$ ld -m elf_i386 <file>.o -o <file>
```

> The string `elf_i386` allow to compile in 64 bits.

# Variables

To define variables in a NASM file, for example a string:
```asm
SECTION .data
msg     db        'Hello World!' , 0Ah
```

# Functions
To start the program we must use the `EAX` instruction. For example, `EAX=1` will call `sys_exit`, or `EAX=4` will call `sys_write`. The instructions `EBX`, `ECX` and `EDX` will be passed as arguments. To interrupt a function we must end with the `INT` instruction.

To start a program, call the function `_start`:
```asm
global  _start
 
_start:
```

Then start the program.

## sys_exit
To terminate a program we must set `EBX` as **0**, and `EAX` as **1**:
```asm
    mov     ebx, 0      
    mov     eax, 1
    int     80h
```

## sys_write
Allow console output. We need to use:
- **EDX**: lenght in bytes of the string.
- **ECX**: address of our `.data` section.
- **EBX**: file we want to write.

The code will look like:
```asm
    mov     edx, 13    
    mov     ecx, msg    
    mov     ebx, 1      
    mov     eax, 4     
    int     80h
```

If we don't want to write the exact number of bytes, we can calculate it. For this, we need to loop the array of strings and jump to **zero** (`jz`) when done:
```asm
_start:
 
    mov     ebx, msg        
    mov     eax, ebx        

nextchar:
    cmp     byte [eax], 0   
    jz      finished        
    inc     eax                 
    jmp     nextchar         
finished:
    sub     eax, ebx       

    mov     edx, eax        
    mov     ecx, msg        
    mov     ebx, 1
    mov     eax, 4
    int     80h
 
    mov     ebx, 0
    mov     eax, 1
    int     80h
```
