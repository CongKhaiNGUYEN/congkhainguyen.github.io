# Handling

## Extension

First of all, the most vulnerable moment of malware analysis is when you transmit malware (from one machine to another, through the net). One basic security measure is changing the extension, for example making **malware.exe** into **malware.exe.malz**.

## File order

When handling with malware files keep an ordered structure. Take for example the following tree:

```
├── malware.7z
│   ├── malware-samples
│   │   └── sampl01
│   │       └── sample01.Calc.exe.malz.7z
│   └── README.txt
```

This way we have a main folder (in a ZIP format), inside we have each malware in their folder, with another zip with the malware sample. Added at the end the **.malz** to prevent involuntary execution after decompress it. Add a password in the malware ZIP. This doesn’t need to be a strong password, just a security measure to keep sure that you know what you are doing. The default password is `infected`.

Keep a descriptive name for the malware until you know what it is. Start by something like **malware…** or **sample01…** and then keeps the rest of the file name. Don’t forget adding at the end a random extension to prevent execution.

When you know what type it is, you can start changing the file name to a more descriptive one.

# Sourcing

You don’t need to navigate to weird pages on the dark web to find malware. There are some trustful resources across the Internet and GitHub for finding malware.

Some worth-watching repository could be:

- [theZoo](https://github.com/ytisf/theZoo), with their [webpage](https://thezoo.morirt.com/)
- [vx-underground](https://www.vx-underground.org/), with their [Github repo](https://github.com/vxunderground/MalwareSourceCode)
- [zeltser](https://zeltser.com/), a repository of repositories
