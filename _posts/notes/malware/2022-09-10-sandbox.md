For the automation of analysis of malware we should use **sandboxes**. We can try with https://github.com/mttaggart/blue-jupyter.

# Blue Jupyter

## Installation

In a Linux host (we can use **REMnux**) copy the git:

```console
remnux@remnux:~$ pip3 install jupyter
remnux@remnux:~$ git clone https://github.com/mttaggart/blue-jupyter
remnux@remnux:~$ cd blue-jupyter; pip3 install poetry
```

To make it work we may have to add the **poetry** binary to the PATH and install the Python enviroments (`pip install virtualenv`). Then install the jupyter and launch it:

```console
remnux@remnux:~/blue-jupyter$ poetry install
remnux@remnux:~/blue-jupyter$ poetry shell
(blue-jupyter-py3.8) remnux@remnux:~/blue-jupyter$ cd <NOTEBOOK DIRECTORY>
```

Currently, we have **malware-analysis**, **log-analysis** and **incident-response**. Once we are in one:

```console
(blue-jupyter-py3.8) remnux@remnux:~/blue-jupyter/<NOTEBOOK>$ jupyter notebook
```

## Usage

Select the samples you want to try and added them to the `dropbox`{: .filepath} directory. The process now is automatic. In the Jupyter file just click on run and let the program perform the analysis.
