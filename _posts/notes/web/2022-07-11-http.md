> **HTTP**: Hypertext Transfer Protocol.
{: .prompt-tip }

The majority of the internet nowadays use HTTP. The term refers as text contains links to other resources.
The basic of an HTTP needs a server and a client. The client send a request, the server process it. This request is made within a **FQDN** (Fully Qualified Domain Name) through a **URL** (Uniform Resource Locator).

The default HTTP port is **80**.

# URL

HTTP resource are access by a URL. The URL has some parameters, but only the scheme and host are required.
This are the parameters:

| Component      | Example       | Description                      |
|:---------------|:--------------|---------------------------------:|
| Scheme         | https://      | Protocol used                    |
| User Info      | user:pass@    | Authentication                   |
| Host           | zerop.io      | Server, can be an IP             |
| Port           | :80           | Port used                        |
| Path           | /index.php    | File accesed (default is index)  |
| Query String   | ?search=true  | Parameters inside the URL        |
| Fragments      | #login        | Resources inside the page        |


# Flow

![HTTP Flow](/assets/img/notes/HTTP_Flow.png)

This is the basic flow of a HTTP request. When the browser gets the IP address from the domain sends a GET method to check.
If the request is correct the response will contain the **status code 200**.


> First it checks the local file **/etc/hosts**.

# HTTPS

The real issue with HTTP is that all the data is transferred in clear text. This will help an intruder.
Due to this, the **HTTPS** (HTTP Secure) was born. Even if an attacker perform a MiTM, he will only get encrypted data.

This is the flow in an HTTPS request:

![HTTPS Flow](/assets/img/notes/HTTPS_Flow.png)

The default port for HTTPS is **443**.

---

# Request

This is a HTTP request:

![HTTP Request](/assets/img/notes/raw_request.png)

The structure of a request is the following:

| Field   | Example           | Description  |
|:--------|:------------------|-------------:|
| Method  | GET               | HTTP method  |
| Path    | /users/login.html | Resource     |
| Version | HTTP/1.1          | HTTP version |

The HTTP headers are a set of values that travels with the request.

# Response

![HTTP Response](/assets/img/notes/raw_response.png)

As the request, the response also has headers.
The response send the HTTP version and the **response code** (200 is OK, which means that the response is correct).

# HTTP headers

## General headers

This headers are used in request and response:

| Header        | Example                              | Description                                                                                                     |
|:--------------|:-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| Date          | Date: Wed, 16 Feb 2022 10:38:44 GMT  | Date of the request/response                                                                                    |
| Connection    | Connection: close                    | Set if the connection should stay after the request finished. There are two types: **close** and **keep-alive** |

## Entity headers

Entity headers describe the contents. Can be used in both:

| Header           | Example                     | Description                                                                                           |

| Media-Type       | Media-Type: application/pdf | Similar to Content-Type. This header can play a crucial role in making the server interpret our input |
| Boundary         | boundary="b4e4fbd93540"     | Separate content from one message to other                                                            |
| Content-Length   | Content-Length: 385         | Size of the entity being passed                                                                       |
| Content-Encoding | Content-Encoding: gzip      | Type of encoding used                                                                                 |

# GET

## HTTP Basic Auth 

A basic login would be the one the page ask directly with a pop up alert. Without HTTPS all the data send will be unencrypted, raw.
With the **curl** command we can login sending the credentials via the command (with the option **-u** or in the URL).

In a basic HTTP auth the header for authentication can be something similar to: `Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46YWRtaW4=`, which are a **base64** encryption of admin:admin.
In modern authentication the token would be much larger (authorization of type **Bearer**).
We can use the syntax `curl -H 'Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46YWRtaW4=' http:://zeropio.github.io/login/` to get in.

Nowadays the page create a cookie after the login, so we can mantain the session.

## GET parameters

The GET parameters can be used directly in the URL. For example a search: **https://zeropio.github.io/?search=sql**.

# POST

As differ from GET, POST send the parameters via the body instead of the URL. This has three main benefits:
- Lack of logging: transfer large size files
- Less encoding requeriments: the body allow more encoding than the URL
- More data can be sent: URL has a maximum size

# CRUD API 

An endpoint API is the resource of the web that contact with an API. It can be seen as `https://zeropio.github.io/api.php/country/spain`.
APIs usually perform in four methods:

| Operation | HTTP Method | Description  |
|:----------|:------------|-------------:|
| Create    | POST        | Adds data    |
| Read      | GET         | Reads data   |
| Update    | PUT         | Updates data |
| Delete    | DELETE      | Deletes data |
