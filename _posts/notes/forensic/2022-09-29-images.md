# Stego

## Steghide

Steghide is steganography program which hides bits of a data file in some of the least significant bits of another file in such a way that the existence of the data file is not visible and cannot be proven.

We can get information with:
```console
zero@pio$ steghide info <FILE>
```

We can extract data with:
```console
zero@pio$ steghide --extract --sf <FILE>
```

## Stegseek
