# Simulation

We can simulate a USB copy with:
```console
zero@pio$ sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=<FILE> bs=1024k count=20
zero@pio$ mkfs.vfat <FILE>
zero@pio$ sudo losetup <DISK> <FILE>
```

> <DISK> must be something like `/dev/loop6`
{: .prompt-info}

With this we have the file connected like it is an external usb. Now we can mount it as a normal USB.
```console
zero@pio$ sudo mount /dev/loop6 /mnt
```

We can insert some images now to simulate files and unmount it. So now we have a simulated usb image. To remove the file in the usb we can use the `-d` flag and the disk we selected.

# Analysis

First we start collecting the hashes with `md5sum`, `sha256sum`... We will be using `foremost` to perform an analysis without mount:
```console
zero@pio$ foremost -i <FILE> -o output
```

This tool will recover all the files it can. It has a high margin error, by getting false positives.
