Password cracking, or offline brute force attacks, is an effective way of gaining access to unauthorized resources. Various applications and systems make use of cryptographic algorithms to hash or encrypt data. Doing so prevents the storage of plaintext information in data at rest and disclosure of transmitted data in man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack scenarios. Password cracking attacks attempt to recover the original data by performing brute force attacks against various algorithms and divulge the cleartext password.

Hashing is the process of converting some text to a string, which is unique to that particular text. Usually, a hash function always returns hashes with the same length irrespective of the type, length, or size of the data. Hashing is a one-way process, meaning there is no way of reconstructing the original plaintext from a hash. Some common examples:
- MD5
- SHA256
- PBKDF2
- HMAC
One protection employed against the brute-forcing of hashes is **salting**. A salt is a random piece of data added to the plaintext before hashing it. This increases the computation time but does not prevent brute force altogether. We can easily hash a string:
```console
zero@pio$ echo -n "p@ssword" | md5sum

0f359740bd1cda994f8b55330c86d845
```

With salting, we add a random string:
```console
zero@pio$ echo -n "p@ssw0rd123456" | md5sum

f64c413ca36f5cfe643ddbec4f7d92d0
```

By the other hand, encryption is the process of converting data into a format in which the original content is not accessible. Unlike hashing, encryption is reversible. For example Caesar, Bacon or Substitution. 

The symmetric encryption use a **key** to encrypt and decrypt:
```console
zero@pio$ python3

>>> from pwn import xor
>>> xor("p@ssword", "secret")
b'\x03%\x10\x01\x12D\x01\x01'
```

This can be reversed:
```console
zero@pio$ python3 

>>> from pwn import xor
>>> xor('\x03%\x10\x01\x12D\x01\x01', "secret")
b'p@ssw0rd'
```

> The `b` means that they are bytes strings.
{: .prompt-info}


The asymmetric encryption divide the keys in two, public and private. This encryption is used in SSL.

# Identifying Hashes 

Most hashing algorithms produce hashes of a constant length. The length of a particular hash can be used to map it to the algorithm it was hashed with. For example, a hash of 32 characters in length can be an **MD5** or **NTLM** hash. Sometimes, hashes are stored in certain formats. For example, `hash:salt` or `$id$salt$hash`. The hash `2fc5a684737ce1bf7b3b239df432416e0dd07357:2014` is a **SHA1** hash with the salt of 2014. The hash `$6$vb1tLY1qiY$M.1ZCqKtJBxBtZm1gRi8Bbkn39KU0YJW1cuMFzTRANcNKFKR4RmAQVk4rqQQCkaJT6wXqjUkFcA/qNxLyqW.U/` contains three fields delimited by `$`, where the first field is the id. This is used to identify the type of algorithm used for hashing.

The following list contains some ids and their corresponding algorithms:

| **ID**   | **Algorithm**    |
|--------------- | --------------- |
| `$1$` | MD5 |
| `$2a$` | Blowfish |
| `$2y$` | Blowfish, with correct handling of 8 bit characters |
| `$5$` | SHA256 |
| `$6$` | SHA512 |

## hashID 

[hashID](https://github.com/psypanda/hashID) is a Python tool to detect some types of hashes. It can be installed with **pip**:
```console
zero@pio$ pip install hashid
```

The usage is:
```console
zero@pio$ hashid '<hash>'

Analyzing '<hash>'
[+] MD5(APR) 
[+] Apache MD5
```

Also, sometimes it can provide us the **hashcat** option with the flag `-m`:
```console
zero@pio$ hashid '<hash>' -m
Analyzing '<hash>'
[+] Domain Cached Credentials 2 [Hashcat Mode: 2100
```

It is not always possible to identify the algorithm based on the obtained hash. Depending on the software, the plaintext might undergo multiple encryption rounds and salting transformations, making it harder to recover. Oftentimes hashid will provide many possibilities for a given hash, and we will still be left with a certain amount of guesswork to identify a given hash. Knowing where a hash came from will greatly help us narrow down the hash type and, therefore, the Hashcat hash mode necessary to attempt to crack it.

# Hashcat 

The installation is as simply as:
```console
zero@pio$ sudo apt install hashcat
```

As always, the option `-h` provides us information about the usage. The flags `-a` and `-m` are used to specify the type of attack and hash type. This are the following attack modes:

| **#**   | **Mode**    |
|--------------- | --------------- |
| 0 | Straight |
| 1 | Combination |
| 3 | Brute-force |
| 6 | Hybrid Wordlist + Mask |
| 7 | Hybrid Mask + Wordlist |

[Here](https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=example_hashes) are a complete list of all type of hash. The option `--example-hashes` provides examples of the hash types. We can also check the hash rate adding the flag `-b`, enabling the benchmark mode.

Hashcat has two ways to optimize:

| **Option**   | **Description**    |
|--------------- | --------------- |
| *Optimized Kernels* | with the flag `-0`(which means **Enable optimized kernels (limits password length)**).The magical password length number is generally 32, with most wordlists won't even hit that number. This can take the estimated time from days to hours, so it is always recommended to run with -O first and then rerun after without the -O if your GPU is idle. |
| *Workload* | with the flag `-w` (which means **Enable a specific workload profile**). The default number is 2, but if you want to use your computer while Hashcat is running, set this to 1. If you plan on the computer only running Hashcat, this can be set to 3. |

It is important to note that the use of `--force` should be avoided. It can lead to false positives, false negatives, malfunctions, etc.

## Dictionary Attack 

The basic syntax for a hashcat usage is:
```console
zero@pio$ hashcat -a 0 -m <hash type> <hash file> <wordlist>
```

At any time during the cracking process, you can hit the `s` key to get a status on the cracking job, which shows that to attempt every password in the **rockyou.txt** wordlist will take over 1.5 hours.

## Combination Attack 

The combination attack modes take in two wordlists as input and create combinations from them. This attack is useful because it is not uncommon for users to join two or more words together (for example `hotelcalifornia`).

The syntax is:
```console
zero@pio$ hashcat -a 1 -m <hash type> <hash file> <wordlist1> <wordlist2>
```

## Mask Attack 

Mask attacks are used to generate words matching a specific pattern. This type of attack is particularly useful when the password length or format is known. A mask can be created using static characters, ranges of characters (e.g. [a-z] or [A-Z0-9]), or placeholders. The following list shows some important placeholders:

| **Placeholder**   | **Description**    |
|--------------- | --------------- |
| `?l` | lower-case ASCII letters (a-z) |
| `?u` | upper-case ASCII letters (A-Z) |
| `?d` | digits (0-9) |
| `?h` | 0123456789abcdef |
| `?H` | 0123456789ABCDEF |
| `?s` | special characters |
| `?a` | ?l?u?d?s |
| `?b` | 0x00 - 0xff |

That can be combined with the options `-1` to `-4` (custom placeholders). More info [here](https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=mask_attack).

Let's take for example the following password scheme `zeropio<userid><year>`, where userid is 5 characters long. We can use the mask `zeropio?l?l?l?l?l20[0-1]?d`. The syntax will be:
```console
zero@pio$ hashcat -a 3 -m 0 <hash file> -1 01 'zeropio?l?l?l?l?l20?1?d'
```

The `-1` option was used to specify a placeholder with just **0** and **1**.

## Hybrid Mode

Hybrid mode is a variation of the combinator attack, wherein multiple modes can be used together for a fine-tuned wordlist creation. The attack mode for the hybrid attack is `6`.

Let's use the password `football1$`.  In this case, the mask `?d?s` tells hashcat to append a digit and a special character at the end of each word in the **rockyou.txt** wordlist.
```console
zero@pio$ hashcat -a 6 -m 0 <hash file> <wordlist> '?d?s'
```

Attack mode `7` can be used to prepend characters to words using a given mask:
```console
zero@pio$ hashcat -a 7 -m 0 <hash file> -1 01 '20?1?d' <wordlist>
```

# Creating Wordlist 

## Crunch 

Crunch can create wordlists based on parameters such as words of a specific length, a limited character set, or a certain pattern. It can generate both permutations and combinations.
```console
zero@pio$ crunch <minimum length> <maximum length> <charset> -t <pattern> -o <output file>
```

For example:
```console
zero@pio$ crunch 4 8 -o wordlist
zero@pio$ crunch 17 17 -t zeropio201%@@@@ -o wordlist
zero@pio$ crunch 12 12 -t 10031998@@@@ -d 1 -o wordlist
```

## CUPP 

CUPP stands for Common User Password Profiler, and is used to create highly targeted and customized wordlists based on information gained from social engineering and OSINT.

```console
zero@pio$ cupp -i

> First Name: 
> Surname: 
> Nickname:      
> Birthdate (DDMMYYYY): 

> Partners) name: 
> Partners) nickname:
> Partners) birthdate (DDMMYYYY):

> Child's name: 
> Child's nickname: 
> Child's birthdate (DDMMYYYY):

> Pet's name: tommy
> Company name: 

> Do you want to add some key words about the victim? Y/[N]: y
> Please enter the words, separated by comma. [i.e. hacker,juice,black], spaces will be removed: 
> Do you want to add special chars at the end of words? Y/[N]:
> Do you want to add some random numbers at the end of words? Y/[N]:
> Leet mode? (i.e. leet = 1337) Y/[N]:

[+] Now making a dictionary...
[+] Sorting list and removing duplicates...
[+] Saving dictionary to <file>.txt, counting <number> words.
[+] Now load your pistolero with <file>.txt and shoot! Good luck!
```

## KWPROCESSOR 

Kwprocessor is a tool that creates wordlists with keyboard walks. You need to install from [Github](https://github.com/hashcat/kwprocessor).
```console
zero@pio$ kwp -s 1 basechars/full.base keymaps/en-us.keymap  routes/2-to-10-max-3-direction-changes.route
```

## Princeprocessor 

PRINCE or PRobability INfinite Chained Elements is an efficient password guessing algorithm to improve password cracking rates. You can found [here](https://github.com/hashcat/princeprocessor).

## CeWL 

CeWL is another tool that can be used to create custom wordlists. It spiders and scrapes a website and creates a list of the words that are present.
```console
zero@pio$ cewl -d <depth to spider> -m <minimum word length> -w <output wordlist> <url of website>
```

# Working with Rules 

The rule-based attack is the most advanced and complex password cracking mode.Rules help perform various operations on the input wordlist, such as prefixing, suffixing, toggling case, cutting, reversing, and much more. Rules take mask-based attacks to another level and provide increased cracking rates.

A rule can be created using functions, which take a word as input and output it's modified version. The following table describes some functions which are compatible with JtR as well as Hashcat.

| **Function**    | **Description**    | **Input**    | **Output** |
|---------------- | --------------- | --------------- | ----------- |
| `l` |	Convert all letters to lowercase |	InlaneFreight2020	| inlanefreight2020 |
| `u` |	Convert all letters to uppercase |	InlaneFreight2020	| INLANEFREIGHT2020 |
| `c` / `C` |	capitalize / lowercase first letter and invert the rest |	inlaneFreight2020 / Inlanefreight2020	| Inlanefreight2020 / iNLANEFREIGHT2020 |
| `t` / `TN` |	Toggle case : whole word / at position N	| InlaneFreight2020	| iNLANEfREIGHT2020 |
| `d` / `q` / `zN` / `ZN` |	Duplicate word / all characters / first character / last character |	InlaneFreight2020	| InlaneFreight2020InlaneFreight2020 / IInnllaanneeFFrreeiigghhtt22002200 / IInlaneFreight2020 / InlaneFreight20200 |
| `{` / `}` |	Rotate word left / right	| InlaneFreight2020	| nlaneFreight2020I / 0InlaneFreight202 |
| `^X` / `$X` |	Prepend / Append character X |	InlaneFreight2020 (^! / $! ) |	!InlaneFreight2020 / InlaneFreight2020! |
| `r` | Reverse |	InlaneFreight2020 |	0202thgierFenalnI |

A complete list [here](https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=rule_based_attack#implemented_compatible_functions).

## Example Rule Creation 

With this rules:
```
c so0 si1 se3 ss5 sa@ $2 $0 $1 $9
```

The first letter word is capitalized with the `c` function. Then rule uses the substitute function `s` to replace `o` with `0`, `i` with `1`, `e` with `3` and a with `@`. At the end, the year `2019` is appended to it. 

Send this rule to a file and use it:
```console
zero@pio$ echo 'so0 si1 se3 ss5 sa@ c $2 $0 $1 $9' > rule.txt 
zero@pio$ echo 'password' > test.txt 
zero@pio$ hashcat -r rule.txt test.txt --stdout

P@55w0rd
```

Or for cracking:
```console
zero@pio$ hashcat -a 0 -m 100 <hash file> <wordlist> -r rule.txt
```

We have a list of rules in `/usr/share/hashcat/rules/`{: .filepath}. To generate random rules:
```console
zero@pio$ hashcat -a 0 -m 100 -g 1000 hash /opt/useful/SecLists/Passwords/Leaked-Databases/rockyou.txt
```

There are more rules in:

## Wireless (WPA/WPA2) Handshakes 

### MIC 

To perform this type of offline cracking attack, we need to capture a valid 4-way handshake by sending de-authentication frames to force a client (user) to disconnect from an **AP** (Access Point). When the client reauthenticates (usually automatically), the attacker can attempt to sniff out the WPA 4-way handshake without their knowledge.

We will need a util:
```console
zero@pio$ git clone https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat-utils.git; cd hashcat-utils/src; make
```

To convert a pcap capture to crackable file:
```console
zero@pio$ ./cap2hccapx.bin corp_capture1-01.cap mic_to_crack.hccapx
```

To crack:
```console
zero@pio$ hashcat -a 0 -m 22000 mic_to_crack.hccapx /opt/useful/SecLists/Passwords/Leaked-Databases/rockyou.txt
```

### PMKID 

This attack can be performed against wireless networks that use WPA/WPA2-PSK (pre-shared key) and allows us to obtain the PSK being used by the targeted wireless network by attacking the AP directly. The Pairwise Master Key Identifier (PMKID) is the AP's unique identifier to keep track of the Pairwise Master Key (PMK) used by the client.

To get a PMKID hash we will use `hcxtools`:
```console
zero@pio$ hcxpcaptool -z pmkidhash_corp cracking_pmkid.cap
```

To crack the PMKID:
```console
zero@pio$ hashcat -a 0 -m 22000 pmkidhash_corp /opt/useful/SecLists/Passwords/Leaked-Databases/rockyou.txt
```
