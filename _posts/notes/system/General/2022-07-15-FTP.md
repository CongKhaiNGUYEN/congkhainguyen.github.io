# FTP 

The File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is a standard network protocol used to transfer files between computers. By default, FTP listens on port **TCP/21**. To attack an FTP Server, we can abuse misconfiguration or excessive privileges, exploit known vulnerabilities or discover new vulnerabilities. To perform a basic connection to a FTP:
```console
zero@pio$ ftp <ip>
```

We can download all the aviables file in a system with:
```console
zero@pio$ wget -m --no-passive ftp://<USER>:<PASSWORD>@<IP>
```

Inside, basic commands can be use:

| **Command**   | **Description**    |
|--------------- | --------------- |
| `ls`   | List files and folders   |
| `cd <path>`   | Change directory   |
| `get <FILE>`   | Download file in our machine   |
| `put <FILE>` | Uplaod file from our machine |
| `exit`   | Exit the FTP   |

A full command list [here](https://www.smartfile.com/blog/the-ultimate-ftp-commands-list/), with a list of the status [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_FTP_server_return_codes).


We can enumerate it with Nmap:
```console
zero@pio$ sudo nmap -sCV -p 21 <TARGET>
```

We can abuse the misconfiguration to try to loggin as the **Anonymous** user:
```console
zero@pio$ ftp <TARGET> 

Name (<TARGET>:kali): anonymous
331 Please specify the password.
Password:
230 Login successful.
Remote system type is UNIX.
Using binary mode to transfer files.
ftp>
```

We can use [Medusa](https://github.com/jmk-foofus/medusa) to brute forcing:
```console
zero@pio$ medusa -u <USER> -P <WORDLIST> -h <TARGET> -n <PORT> -M ftp 
```

## FTP Bounce Attack 

An FTP bounce attack is a network attack that uses FTP servers to deliver outbound traffic to another device on the network. The attacker uses a PORT command to trick the FTP connection into running commands and getting information from a device other than the intended server. Consider we are targetting an FTP Server **FTP_DMZ** exposed to the internet. Another device within the same network, **Internal_DMZ**, is not exposed to the internet. We can use the connection to the **FTP_DMZ** server to scan **Internal_DMZ** using the FTP Bounce attack and obtain information about the server's open ports.

The Nmap `-b` flag can be used to perform an FTP bounce attack:
```console
zero@pio$ nmap -Pn -v -n -p80 -b <USER>:<PASSWORD>@<TARGET> <BOUNCE TARGET>
```
