# SNMP

SNMP Community strings provide information and statistics about a router or device, helping us gain access to it. The manufacturer default community strings of public and private are often unchanged. In SNMP versions 1 and 2c, access is controlled using a plaintext community string, and if we know the name, we can gain access to it. Encryption and authentication were only added in SNMP version 3.

```console
zero@pio$ snmpwalk -v 2c -c public <ip> 1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5.0

iso.3.6.1.2.1.1.5.0 = STRING: "gs-svcscan"
```

```console
zero@pio$ snmpwalk -v 2c -c private  <ip>

Timeout: No Response from <ip>
```

It can be used the tool [onesixtyone](https://github.com/trailofbits/onesixtyone):

```console
zero@pio$ onesixtyone -c dict.txt <ip>

```
