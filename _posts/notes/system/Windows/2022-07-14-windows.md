# Fundamentals

## Version

| **OS Name**   | **Version number**    |
|--------------- | --------------- |
| Windows NT 4   | 4.0   |
| Windows 2000	   | 5.0   |
| Windows XP	   | 5.1   |
| Windows Server 2003, 2003 R2 | 5.2   |

We can check our version with:
```console
PS C:\zeropio> Get-WmiObject -Class win32_OperatingSystem | select Version,BuildNumber
```

## Permission

The **Integrity Control Access Control List** (icacls) can see permissions and modify:
```console
C:\zeropio> icacls c:\windows
c:\windows NT SERVICE\TrustedInstaller:(F)
           NT SERVICE\TrustedInstaller:(CI)(IO)(F)
           NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM:(M)
           NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM:(OI)(CI)(IO)(F)
           BUILTIN\Administrators:(M)
           BUILTIN\Administrators:(OI)(CI)(IO)(F)
           BUILTIN\Users:(RX)
           BUILTIN\Users:(OI)(CI)(IO)(GR,GE)
           CREATOR OWNER:(OI)(CI)(IO)(F)
           APPLICATION PACKAGE AUTHORITY\ALL APPLICATION PACKAGES:(RX)
           APPLICATION PACKAGE AUTHORITY\ALL APPLICATION PACKAGES:(OI)(CI)(IO)(GR,GE)
           APPLICATION PACKAGE AUTHORITY\ALL RESTRICTED APPLICATION PACKAGES:(RX)
           APPLICATION PACKAGE AUTHORITY\ALL RESTRICTED APPLICATION PACKAGES:(OI)(CI)(IO)(GR,GE)

Successfully processed 1 files; Failed processing 0 files
```

| **Flag**   | **Meaning**    |
|--------------- | --------------- |
| `CI`   | container inherit   |
| `OI`   | object inherit   |
| `IO`   | inherit only   |
| `NP`   | do not propagate inherit   |
| `I`    | permission inherited from parent container |

| **Flag**   | **Meaning**    |
|--------------- | --------------- |
| `F`   | full access   |
| `D`   | delete access |
| `N`   | no access   |
| `M`   | modify access   |
| `RX`  | read and execute access |
| `R`   | read-only access |
| `W`   | write-only access |

We can change permissions with **icacl**:
```console
C:\zeropio> icacls c:\Users
c:\Users NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM:(OI)(CI)(F)
         BUILTIN\Administrators:(OI)(CI)(F)
         BUILTIN\Users:(RX)
         BUILTIN\Users:(OI)(CI)(IO)(GR,GE)
         Everyone:(RX)
         Everyone:(OI)(CI)(IO)(GR,GE)

Successfully processed 1 files; Failed processing 0 files
C:\zeropio> icacls c:\users /grant zeropio:f
C:\htb> >icacls c:\users
c:\users WS01\zeropio:(F)
         NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM:(OI)(CI)(F)
         BUILTIN\Administrators:(OI)(CI)(F)
         BUILTIN\Users:(RX)
         BUILTIN\Users:(OI)(CI)(IO)(GR,GE)
         Everyone:(RX)
         Everyone:(OI)(CI)(IO)(GR,GE)

Successfully processed 1 files; Failed processing 0 files
C:\zeropio> icacls c:\users /remove joe
```

More commands [here](https://ss64.com/nt/icacls.html).

## Services

Windows services are managed via the Service Control Manager (SCM) system, accessible via the **services.msc**. For example:
```console
PS C:\zeropio> Get-Service | ? {$_.Status -eq "Running"} | select -First 2 |fl
```

We can manage them with `sc`:

- Query the service (even from other machines)
```console
C:\zeropio> sc qc <service>
C:\zeropio> sc //<ip> query <service>
```

- Start and stop (need **administrator** privileges)

```console
C:\zeropio> sc stop <service>
C:\zeropio> sc start <service>
[SC] OpenService FAILED 5:

Access is denied.

C:\WINDOWS\system32> sc stop <service>
```

- Get security descriptor
Security descriptors identify the objectâ€™s owner and a primary group containing a Discretionary Access Control List (**DACL**) and a System Access Control List (**SACL**). Generally, a DACL is used for controlling access to an object, and a SACL is used to account for and log access attempts.
```console
C:\zeropio> sc sdshow <service>
D:(A;;CCLCSWRPLORC;;;AU)(A;;CCDCLCSWRPWPDTLOCRSDRCWDWO;;;BA)(A;;CCDCLCSWRPWPDTLOCRSDRCWDWO;;;SY)S:(AU;FA;CCDCLCSWRPWPDTLOSDRCWDWO;;;WD)
```
This amalgamation of characters crunched together and delimited by opened and closed parentheses is in a format known as the Security Descriptor Definition Language (**SDDL**).

Let's see each character:
**D: (A;;CCLCSWRPLORC;;;AU)**

| **Character**   | **Description**    |
|--------------- | --------------- |
| `D:`   | DACL permissions   |
| `AU:`   | security principal Authenticated Users   |
| `A;;`   | access is allowed   |
| `CC`   | SERVICE\_QUERY\_CONFIG, query to the service control manager (SCM) for the service configuration   |
| `LC` | SERVICE\_QUERY\_STATUS, query to the service control manager (SCM) for the current status of the service |
| `SW` | SERVICE\_ENUMERATE\_DEPENDENTS, it will enumerate a list of dependent services |
| `RP` | SERVICE\_START, it will start the service |
| `LO` | SERVICE\_INTERROGATE, it will query the service for its current status |
| `RC` | READ\_CONTROL, it will query the security descriptor of the service |

- Using PowerShell
```console
PS C:\zeropio> Get-ACL -Path HKLM:\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\<service> | Format-List
```

## LSASS

Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (`lsass.exe`) is responsible for enforcing the security policy on Windows systems. For example, loggint attempts.

## Sysinternals Tools

The SysInternals Tools suite is a set of portable Windows applications that can be used to administer Windows systems (for the most part without requiring installation). The tools can be either downloaded from the Microsoft website or by loading them directly from an internet-accessible file share.

```console
C:\zeropio> \\live.sysinternals.com\tools\procdump.exe -accepteula
```

It has some tools as:
- Process Explorer
- Task Manager 
- Process Monitor
- TCPView
- PSExec
- Active Directory Explorer

## Command Line

### cmd
The Command Prompt is the "Windows Shell". Locate in `C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe`{: .filepath}. Some helpful commands:
```console
C:\zeropio> help
C:\zeropio> help ipconfig
C:\zeropio> ipconfig /?
```

### PowerShell
> Windows PowerShell is a command shell that was designed by Microsoft to be more geared towards system administrators. 
{: .prompt-info }

#### cmdlets
PowerShell uses **cmdlets**, which are small single-function tools built into the shell. Their syntax is **Verb-Noun**, for example:
- **Get-ChildItem** list our current directory
  - **Get-ChildItem -** to iterate through the arguments
  - **Get-ChildItem -Recurse** will show us the contents of our current working directory and all subdirectories
  - **Get-ChildItem -Path \<path\>** to get the contents of another directory
  - **Get-ChildItem -Path \<path\> -Recurse**

#### aliases
Many cmdlets have aliases: **Set-Location** -> **cd**/**sl**. Or **Get-ChildItem** -> **ls**/**cgi**.
We can view all with `Get-Alias`. Or set new with `New-Alias`:
```console
PS C:\zeropio> New-Alias -Name "Show-Files" Get-ChildItem
```

#### Running scripts
The **PowerShell ISE** (Integrated Scripting Environment) allows user to write scripts. For example:
```console
PS C:\zeropio> .\PowerView.ps1;Get-LocalGroup | fl
```
We can import the scripts to our session:
```console
PS C:\zeropio> Import-Module .\PowerView.ps1
```

#### Execution Policy 

Sometimes we will find that we are unable to run scripts on a system. This is due to a security feature that attempts to prevent the execution of malicious scripts called the execution policy. The possible policies are:

| **Policy**   | **Description**    |
|--------------- | --------------- |
| **AllSigned**   | All scripts can run, but a trusted publisher must sign scripts and configuration files   |
| **Bypass**   | No scripts or configuration files are blocked, and the user receives no warnings or prompts   |
| **Default**   | This sets the default execution policy, Restricted for Windows desktop machines and RemoteSigned for Windows servers   |
| **RemoteSigned**   | Scripts can run but requires a digital signature on scripts that are downloaded from the internet   |
| **Restricted** | This allows individual commands but does not allow scripts to be run |
| **Undefined** | No execution policy is set for the current scope |
| **Unrestricted** | This is the default execution policy for non-Windows computers, and it cannot be changed |

We can check all with:
```console
PS C:\zeropio> Get-ExecutionPolicy -List
```

## Windows Security

### Security Identifier

The **SID** is a unique string for each user to identify all actions that the user is authorized to take. A SID consists of the Identifier Authority and the Relative ID (RID). In an Active Directory (AD) domain environment, the SID also includes the domain SID.
It has the following pattern:
```
(SID)-(revision level)-(identifier-authority)-(subauthority1)-(subauthority2)-(etc)
```

| **String**   | **Description**    |
|--------------- | --------------- |
| **SID**   | Identifies the string as a SID   |
| **Revision Level**   | To date, this has never changed and has always been 1   |
| **Identifier-authority**   | A 48-bit string that identifies the authority (the computer or network) that created the SID   |
| **Subauthority1**   | This is a variable number that identifies the user's relation or group described by the SID to the authority that created it, It tells us in what order this authority created the user's account   |
| **Subauthority2** | Tells us which computer (or domain) created the number |
| **Subauthority3** | he RID that distinguishes one account from another, tells us whether this user is a normal user, a guest, an administrator, or part of some other group |

### SAM and ACE 

SAM (Security Accounts Manager) grants rights to a network to execute specific processes. The access rights themselves are managed by Access Control Entries (ACE) in Access Control Lists (ACL). The ACLs contain ACEs that define which users, groups, or processes have access to a file or to execute a process, for example.
There are two types of ACLs: Discretionary Access Control List (DACL) or System Access Control List (SACL).

### UAC

User Account Control prevent malware from running or manipulating processes that could damage the computer or its contents. Since the installation requires administrator rights, a window pops up, asking you if you want to confirm the installation. With a standard user who has no rights for the installation, execution will be denied, or you will be asked for the administrator password. This consent prompt interrupts the execution of scripts or binaries that malware or attackers try to execute until the user enters the password or confirms execution. 

### Registry

Is a hierarchical database in Windows critical for the operating system. It stores low-level settings for the Windows operating system and applications that choose to use it.
It can be open typing `regedit` (cmd or Windows search bar).

[This](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/sysinfo/registry-value-types) are the registry values types.

Each folder under Computer is a key. The root keys all start with HKEY. A key such as HKEY-LOCAL-MACHINE is abbreviated to **HKLM**. HKLM contains all settings that are relevant to the local system. This root key contains six subkeys like SAM, SECURITY, SYSTEM, SOFTWARE, HARDWARE, and BCD, loaded into memory at boot time (except HARDWARE which is dynamically loaded).
You can find these files under `C:\Windows\System32\Config\`{: .filepath}.

# Penetration Distro

To create an Pentesting Windows Distro we will need:
- [ISO](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/virtual-machines/)
- [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/)

## Updates

Let's change our updates policies:

### Execution policy

```console
PS C:\zeropio> Get-ExecutionPolicy -List

Scope ExecutionPolicy
----- ---------------
MachinePolicy Undefined
UserPolicy Undefined
Process Undefined
CurrentUser Undefined
LocalMachine Undefined 

PS C:\zeropio> Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope Process

Execution Policy Change
The execution policy helps protect you from scripts that you do not trust. 
Changing the execution policy might expose you to the security risks described in the about_Execution_Policies help topic at https:/go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=135170. Do you want to change the execution policy?
[Y] Yes [A] Yes to All [N] No [L] No to All [S] Suspend [?] Help (default is "N"): A

PS C:\zeropio> Get-ExecutionPolicy -List

Scope ExecutionPolicy
----- ---------------
MachinePolicy Undefined
UserPolicy Undefined
Process Unrestricted
CurrentUser Undefined
LocalMachine Undefined
```

### PSWindowsUpdate

```console
PS C:\zeropio> Install-Module PSWindowsUpdate 

Untrusted repository 
You are installing the modules from an untrusted repository. If you trust this repository, 
change its InstallationPolicy value by running the Set-PSRepository cmdlet. 
Are you sure you want to install the modules from 'PSGallery'?
